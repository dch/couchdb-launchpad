.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
CouchDB is a database that completely embraces the web. Store your data with
JSON documents. Access your documents with your web browser, \fIvia HTTP\fP\&. \fIQuery\fP, \fIcombine\fP,
and \fItransform\fP your documents with \fIJavaScript\fP\&. CouchDB works well with modern web and mobile apps. You can
even serve web apps directly out of CouchDB. And you can distribute your data,
or your apps, efficiently using CouchDB’s \fIincremental replication\fP\&. CouchDB supports master\-master setups with
\fIautomatic conflict\fP detection.
.sp
CouchDB comes with a suite of features, such as on\-the\-fly document
transformation and real\-time \fIchange notifications\fP, that makes
\fIweb app\fP development a breeze. It even comes with an easy
to use web administration console. You guessed it,
served up directly out of CouchDB! We care a lot about \fI\%distributed scaling\fP\&.
CouchDB is highly available and partition tolerant, but is also \fIeventually
consistent\fP\&. And we care \fIa lot\fP about your data.
CouchDB has a fault\-tolerant storage engine that puts the safety of your data
first.
.sp
In this section you\(aqll learn about every basic bit of CouchDB, see upon what
conceptions and technologies it built and walk through short tutorial that
teach how to use CouchDB.
.SS Technical Overview
.SS Document Storage
.sp
A CouchDB server hosts named databases, which store \fBdocuments\fP\&.
Each document is uniquely named in the database, and CouchDB provides
a \fI\%RESTful\fP \fIHTTP API\fP for reading and updating (add, edit,
delete)  database documents.
.sp
Documents are the primary unit of data in CouchDB and consist of any number
of fields and attachments. Documents also include metadata that’s maintained
by the database system. Document fields are uniquely named and contain values
of \fIvarying types\fP (text, number, boolean, lists, etc),
and there is no set limit to text size or element count.
.sp
The CouchDB document update model is lockless and optimistic.
Document edits are made by client applications loading documents,
applying changes, and saving them back to the database. If another client
editing the same document saves their changes first, the client gets an edit
conflict error on save. To resolve the update conflict, the latest document
version can be opened, the edits reapplied and the update tried again.
.sp
Document updates (add, edit, delete) are all or nothing, either succeeding
entirely or failing completely. The database never contains partially saved
or edited documents.
.SS ACID Properties
.sp
The CouchDB file layout and commitment system features all \fIAtomic Consistent
Isolated Durable\fP (\fI\%ACID\fP) properties. On\-disk, CouchDB never overwrites
committed data or associated structures, ensuring the database file is always
in a consistent state. This is a "crash\-only" design where the CouchDB
server does not go through a shut down process, it\(aqs simply terminated.
.sp
Document updates (add, edit, delete) are serialized, except for binary blobs
which are written concurrently. Database readers are never locked out and
never have to wait on writers or other readers. Any number of clients can be
reading documents without being locked out or interrupted by concurrent
updates, even on the same document. CouchDB read operations use a
\fIMulti\-Version Concurrency Control\fP (\fI\%MVCC\fP) model where each client sees a
consistent snapshot of the database from the beginning to the end of the read
operation.
.sp
Documents are indexed in \fI\%B\-trees\fP by their name (DocID) and a Sequence ID.
Each update to a database instance generates a new sequential number.
Sequence IDs are used later for incrementally finding changes in a database.
These B\-tree indexes are updated simultaneously when documents are saved or
deleted. The index updates always occur at the end of the file (append\-only
updates).
.sp
Documents have the advantage of data being already conveniently packaged for
storage rather than split out across numerous tables and rows in most
database systems. When documents are committed to disk, the document fields
and metadata are packed into buffers, sequentially one document after another
(helpful later for efficient building of views).
.sp
When CouchDB documents are updated, all data and associated indexes are
flushed to disk and the transactional commit always leaves the database
in a completely consistent state. Commits occur in two steps:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
All document data and associated index updates are synchronously flushed
to disk.
.IP 2. 3
The updated database header is written in two consecutive, identical chunks
to make up the first 4k of the file, and then synchronously flushed to disk.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the event of an OS crash or power failure during step 1,
the partially flushed updates are simply forgotten on restart. If such a
crash happens during step 2 (committing the header), a surviving copy of the
previous identical headers will remain, ensuring coherency of all previously
committed data. Excepting the header area, consistency checks or fix\-ups
after a crash or a power failure are never necessary.
.SS Compaction
.sp
Wasted space is recovered by occasional compaction. On schedule, or when the
database file exceeds a certain amount of wasted space, the compaction process
clones all the active data to a new file and then discards the old file.
The database remains completely online the entire time and all updates and
reads are allowed to complete successfully. The old database file is deleted
only when all the data has been copied and all users transitioned to the new
file.
.SS Views
.sp
ACID properties only deal with storage and updates, but we also need the ability
to show our data in interesting and useful ways. Unlike SQL databases where
data must be carefully decomposed into tables, data in CouchDB is stored in
semi\-structured documents. CouchDB documents are flexible and each has its
own implicit structure, which alleviates the most difficult problems and
pitfalls of bi\-directionally replicating table schemas and their contained data.
.sp
But beyond acting as a fancy file server, a simple document model for data
storage and sharing is too simple to build real applications on \-\- it simply
doesn\(aqt do enough of the things we want and expect. We want to slice and dice
and see our data in many different ways. What is needed is a way to filter,
organize and report on data that hasn\(aqt been decomposed into tables.

.SS View Model
.sp
To address this problem of adding structure back to unstructured and
semi\-structured data, CouchDB integrates a view model. Views are the method
of aggregating and reporting on the documents in a database, and are built
on\-demand to aggregate, join and report on database documents. Because views
are built dynamically and don’t affect the underlying document, you can have
as many different view representations of the same data as you like.
.sp
View definitions are strictly virtual and only display the documents from the
current database instance, making them separate from the data they display
and compatible with replication. CouchDB views are defined inside special
\fBdesign documents\fP and can replicate across database instances like
regular documents, so that not only data replicates in CouchDB,
but entire application designs replicate too.
.SS JavaScript View Functions
.sp
Views are defined using JavaScript functions acting as the map part in a
\fI\%map\-reduce system\fP\&. A \fIview function\fP takes a CouchDB document
as an argument and then does whatever computation it needs to do to determine
the data that is to be made available through the view, if any.
It can add multiple rows to the view based on a single document,
or it can add no rows at all.
.sp

.SS View Indexes
.sp
Views are a dynamic representation of the actual document contents of a
database, and CouchDB makes it easy to create useful views of data.
But generating a view of a database with hundreds of thousands or millions of
documents is time and resource consuming, it\(aqs not something the system
should do from scratch each time.
.sp
To keep view querying fast, the view engine maintains indexes of its views,
and incrementally updates them to reflect changes in the database.
CouchDB’s core design is largely optimized around the need for efficient,
incremental creation of views and their indexes.
.sp
Views and their functions are defined inside special "design" documents,
and a design document may contain any number of uniquely named view functions.
When a user opens a view and its index is automatically updated, all the views
in the same design document are indexed as a single group.
.sp
The view builder uses the database sequence ID to determine if the view group
is fully up\-to\-date with the database. If not, the view engine examines the
all database documents (in packed sequential order) changed since the last
refresh. Documents are read in the order they occur in the disk file,
reducing the frequency and cost of disk head seeks.
.sp
The views can be read and queried simultaneously while also being refreshed.
If a client is slowly streaming out the contents of a large view,
the same view can be concurrently opened and refreshed for another client
without blocking the first client. This is true for any number of
simultaneous client readers, who can read and query the view while the index
is concurrently being refreshed for other clients without causing problems
for the readers.
.sp
As documents are processed by the view engine through your \(aqmap\(aq and \(aqreduce\(aq
functions, their previous row values are removed from the view indexes, if
they exist. If the document is selected by a view function, the function results
are inserted into the view as a new row.
.sp
When view index changes are written to disk, the updates are always appended
at the end of the file, serving to both reduce disk head seek times during
disk commits and to ensure crashes and power failures can not cause
corruption of indexes. If a crash occurs while updating a view index,
the incomplete index updates are simply lost and rebuilt incrementally from
its previously committed state.
.SS Security and Validation
.sp
To protect who can read and update documents, CouchDB has a simple reader
access and update validation model that can be extended to implement custom
security models.
.sp
\fBSEE ALSO:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIapi/db/security\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Administrator Access
.sp
CouchDB database instances have administrator accounts. Administrator
accounts can create other administrator accounts and update design documents.
Design documents are special documents containing view definitions and other
special formulas, as well as regular fields and blobs.
.SS Update Validation
.sp
As documents are written to disk, they can be validated dynamically by
JavaScript functions for both security and data validation. When the document
passes all the formula validation criteria, the update is allowed to continue.
If the validation fails, the update is aborted and the user client gets an
error response.
.sp
Both the user\(aqs credentials and the updated document are given as inputs to
the validation formula, and can be used to implement custom security models
by validating a user\(aqs permissions to update a document.
.sp
A basic "author only" update document model is trivial to implement,
where document updates are validated to check if the user is listed in an
"author" field in the existing document. More dynamic models are also possible,
like checking a separate user account profile for permission settings.
.sp
The update validations are enforced for both live usage and replicated
updates, ensuring security and data validation in a shared, distributed system.

.SS Distributed Updates and Replication
.sp
CouchDB is a peer\-based distributed database system. It allows users and servers
to access and update the same shared data while disconnected. Those changes can
then be replicated bi\-directionally later.
.sp
The CouchDB document storage, view and security models are designed to work
together to make true bi\-directional replication efficient and reliable.
Both documents and designs can replicate, allowing full database applications
(including application design, logic and data) to be replicated to laptops
for offline use, or replicated to servers in remote offices where slow or
unreliable connections make sharing data difficult.
.sp
The replication process is incremental. At the database level,
replication only examines documents updated since the last replication.
Then for each updated document, only fields and blobs that have changed are
replicated across the network. If replication fails at any step, due to network
problems or crash for example, the next replication restarts at the same
document where it left off.
.sp
Partial replicas can be created and maintained. Replication can be filtered
by a JavaScript function, so that only particular documents or those meeting
specific criteria are replicated. This can allow users to take subsets of a
large shared database application offline for their own use, while maintaining
normal interaction with the application and that subset of data.
.SS Conflicts
.sp
Conflict detection and management are key issues for any distributed edit
system. The CouchDB storage system treats edit conflicts as a common state,
not an exceptional one. The conflict handling model is simple and
"non\-destructive" while preserving single document semantics and allowing for
decentralized conflict resolution.
.sp
CouchDB allows for any number of conflicting documents to exist
simultaneously in the database, with each database instance deterministically
deciding which document is the "winner" and which are conflicts. Only the
winning document can appear in views, while "losing" conflicts are still
accessible and remain in the database until deleted or purged during
database compaction. Because conflict documents are still regular documents,
they replicate just like regular documents and are subject to the same
security and validation rules.
.sp
When distributed edit conflicts occur, every database replica sees the same
winning revision and each has the opportunity to resolve the conflict.
Resolving conflicts can be done manually or, depending on the nature of the
data and the conflict, by automated agents. The system makes decentralized
conflict resolution possible while maintaining single document database
semantics.
.sp
Conflict management continues to work even if multiple disconnected users or
agents attempt to resolve the same conflicts. If resolved conflicts result in
more conflicts, the system accommodates them in the same manner, determining
the same winner on each machine and maintaining single document semantics.

.SS Applications
.sp
Using just the basic replication model, many traditionally single server
database applications can be made distributed with almost no extra work.
CouchDB replication is designed to be immediately useful for basic database
applications, while also being extendable for more elaborate and full\-featured
uses.
.sp
With very little database work, it is possible to build a distributed
document management application with granular security and full revision
histories. Updates to documents can be implemented to exploit incremental
field and blob replication, where replicated updates are nearly as efficient
and incremental as the actual edit differences ("diffs").
.sp
The CouchDB replication model can be modified for other distributed update
models. If the storage engine is enhanced to allow multi\-document update
transactions, it is possible to perform Subversion\-like "all or nothing"
atomic commits when replicating with an upstream server, such that any single
document conflict or validation failure will cause the entire update to fail.
Like Subversion, conflicts would be resolved by doing a "pull" replication to
force the conflicts locally, then merging and  re\-replicating to the upstream
server.
.SS Implementation
.sp
CouchDB is built on the \fI\%Erlang OTP platform\fP, a functional,
concurrent programming language and development platform. Erlang was
developed for real\-time telecom applications with an extreme emphasis on
reliability and availability.
.sp
Both in syntax and semantics, Erlang is very different from conventional
programming languages like C or Java. Erlang uses lightweight "processes" and
message passing for concurrency, it has no shared state threading and all
data is immutable. The robust, concurrent nature of Erlang is ideal for a
database server.
.sp
CouchDB is designed for lock\-free concurrency, in the conceptual model and
the actual Erlang implementation. Reducing bottlenecks and avoiding locks
keeps the entire system working predictably under heavy loads. CouchDB can
accommodate many clients replicating changes, opening and updating documents,
and querying views whose indexes are simultaneously being refreshed for
other clients, without needing locks.
.sp
For higher availability and more concurrent users, CouchDB is designed for
"shared nothing" clustering. In a "shared nothing" cluster, each machine
is independent and replicates data with its cluster mates, allowing individual
server failures with zero downtime. And because consistency scans
and fix\-ups aren’t needed on restart,
if the entire cluster fails \-\- due to a power outage in a datacenter,
for example \-\- the entire CouchDB distributed system becomes immediately
available after a restart.
.sp
CouchDB is built from the start with a consistent vision of a distributed
document database system. Unlike cumbersome attempts to bolt distributed
features on top of the same legacy models and databases,
it is the result of careful ground\-up design, engineering and integration.
The document, view, security and replication models, the special purpose query
language, the efficient and robust disk layout and the concurrent and reliable
nature of the Erlang platform are all carefully integrated for a reliable
and efficient system.
.SS Why CouchDB?
.sp
Apache CouchDB is one of a new breed of database management systems.
This topic explains why there\(aqs a need for new systems as well as the
motivations behind building CouchDB.
.sp
As CouchDB developers, we\(aqre naturally very excited to be using CouchDB.
In this topic we\(aqll share with you the reasons for our enthusiasm.
We\(aqll show you how CouchDB\(aqs schema\-free document model is a better fit
for common applications, how the built\-in query engine is a powerful way
to use and process your data, and how CouchDB\(aqs design lends itself
to modularization and scalability.
.SS Relax
.sp
If there\(aqs one word to describe CouchDB, it is \fIrelax\fP\&. It is the byline
to CouchDB\(aqs official logo and when you start CouchDB, you see:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Apache CouchDB has started. Time to relax.
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Why is relaxation important? Developer productivity roughly doubled in the
last five years. The chief reason for the boost is more powerful tools that
are easier to use. Take Ruby on Rails as an example. It is an infinitely
complex framework, but it\(aqs easy to get started with. Rails is a success
story because of the core design focus on ease of use. This is one reason why
CouchDB is relaxing: learning CouchDB and understanding its core concepts
should feel natural to most everybody who has been doing any work on the Web.
And it is still pretty easy to explain to non\-technical people.
.sp
Getting out of the way when creative people try to build specialized
solutions is in itself a core feature and one thing that CouchDB aims to get
right. We found existing tools too cumbersome to work with during development
or in production, and decided to focus on making CouchDB easy, even a pleasure,
to use.
.sp
Another area of relaxation for CouchDB users is the production setting.
If you have a live running application, CouchDB again goes out of its way
to avoid troubling you. Its internal architecture is fault\-tolerant,
and failures occur in a controlled environment and are dealt with gracefully.
Single problems do not cascade through an entire server system but stay
isolated in single requests.
.sp
CouchDB\(aqs core concepts are simple (yet powerful) and well understood.
Operations teams (if you have a team; otherwise, that\(aqs you) do not have to
fear random behavior and untraceable errors. If anything should go wrong,
you can easily find out what the problem is, but these situations are rare.
.sp
CouchDB is also designed to handle varying traffic gracefully. For instance,
if a website is experiencing a sudden spike in traffic, CouchDB will generally
absorb a lot of concurrent requests without falling over. It may take a little
more time for each request, but they all get answered. When the spike is over,
CouchDB will work with regular speed again.
.sp
The third area of relaxation is growing and shrinking the underlying hardware
of your application. This is commonly referred to as scaling. CouchDB enforces
a set of limits on the programmer. On first look, CouchDB might seem
inflexible, but some features are left out by design for the simple reason
that if CouchDB supported them, it would allow a programmer to create
applications that couldn\(aqt deal with scaling up or down.

.SS A Different Way to Model Your Data
.sp
We believe that CouchDB will drastically change the way you build
document\-based applications. CouchDB combines an intuitive document storage
model with a powerful query engine in a way that\(aqs so simple you\(aqll probably
be tempted to ask, “Why has no one built something like this before?”

.UNINDENT
.sp
CouchDB\(aqs design borrows heavily from web architecture and the concepts of
resources, methods, and representations. It augments this with powerful ways
to query, map, combine, and filter your data. Add fault tolerance, extreme
scalability, and incremental replication, and CouchDB defines a sweet spot
for document databases.
.SS A Better Fit for Common Applications
.sp
We write software to improve our lives and the lives of others. Usually this
involves taking some mundane information such as contacts, invoices,
or receipts and manipulating it using a computer application. CouchDB is a
great fit for common applications like this because it embraces the natural
idea of evolving, self\-contained documents as the very core of its data model.
.SS Self\-Contained Data
.sp
An invoice contains all the pertinent information about a single transaction
the seller, the buyer, the date, and a list of the items or services sold.
As shown in \fIintro/why\-01\fP, there\(aqs no abstract reference on this
piece of paper that points to some other piece of paper with the seller\(aqs
name and address. Accountants appreciate the simplicity of having everything
in one place. And given the choice, programmers appreciate that, too.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 2.5
[image: Self-contained documents]
[image]
Figure 1. Self\-contained documents.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Yet using references is exactly how we model our data in a relational
database! Each invoice is stored in a table as a row that refers to other
rows in other tables one row for seller information, one for the buyer,
one row for each item billed, and more rows still to describe the item
details, manufacturer details, and so on and so forth.
.sp
This isn\(aqt meant as a detraction of the relational model, which is widely
applicable and extremely useful for a number of reasons. Hopefully, though, it
illustrates the point that sometimes your model may not “fit” your data
in the way it occurs in the real world.
.sp
Let\(aqs take a look at the humble contact database to illustrate a different
way of modeling data, one that more closely “fits” its real\-world counterpart
\-\- a pile of business cards. Much like our invoice example, a business card
contains all the important information, right there on the cardstock.
We call this “self\-contained” data, and it\(aqs an important concept
in understanding document databases like CouchDB.
.SS Syntax and Semantics
.sp
Most business cards contain roughly the same information \-\- someone\(aqs identity,
an affiliation, and some contact information. While the exact form of this
information can vary between business cards, the general information being
conveyed remains the same, and we\(aqre easily able to recognize it as a
business card. In this sense, we can describe a business card as a \fIreal\-world
document\fP\&.
.sp
Jan\(aqs business card might contain a phone number but no fax number,
whereas J. Chris\(aqs business card contains both a phone and a fax number. Jan
does not have to make his lack of a fax machine explicit by writing something
as ridiculous as “Fax: None” on the business card. Instead, simply omitting
a fax number implies that he doesn\(aqt have one.
.sp
We can see that real\-world documents of the same type, such as business cards,
tend to be very similar in \fIsemantics\fP \-\- the sort of information they carry,
but can vary hugely in \fIsyntax\fP, or how that information is structured. As human
beings, we\(aqre naturally comfortable dealing with this kind of variation.
.sp
While a traditional relational database requires you to model your data
\fIup front\fP, CouchDB\(aqs schema\-free design unburdens you with a powerful way to
aggregate your data \fIafter the fact\fP, just like we do with real\-world
documents. We\(aqll look in depth at how to design applications with this
underlying storage paradigm.
.SS Building Blocks for Larger Systems
.sp
CouchDB is a storage system useful on its own. You can build many applications
with the tools CouchDB gives you. But CouchDB is designed with a bigger picture
in mind. Its components can be used as building blocks that solve storage
problems in slightly different ways for larger and more complex systems.
.sp
Whether you need a system that\(aqs crazy fast but isn\(aqt too concerned with
reliability (think logging), or one that guarantees storage in two or more
physically separated locations for reliability, but you\(aqre willing to take a
performance hit, CouchDB lets you build these systems.
.sp
There are a multitude of knobs you could turn to make a system work better in
one area, but you\(aqll affect another area when doing so. One example would be
the CAP theorem discussed in \fIintro/consistency\fP\&. To give you an idea of
other things that affect storage systems, see
\fIFigure 2\fP and \fIFigure 3\fP\&.
.sp
By reducing latency for a given system (and that is true not only for storage
systems), you affect concurrency and throughput capabilities.

.sp
When you want to scale out, there are three distinct issues to deal with:
scaling read requests, write requests, and data. Orthogonal to all three and
to the items shown in \fIFigure 2\fP and \fIFigure 3\fP are many more attributes like reliability or simplicity.
You can draw many of these graphs that show how different features or attributes
pull into different directions and thus shape the system they describe.
.sp
CouchDB is very flexible and gives you enough building blocks to create a
system shaped to suit your exact problem. That\(aqs not saying that CouchDB can
be bent to solve any problem \-\- CouchDB is no silver bullet \-\- but in the
area of data storage, it can get you a long way.
.SS CouchDB Replication
.sp
CouchDB replication is one of these building blocks. Its fundamental function
is to synchronize two or more CouchDB databases. This may sound simple,
but the simplicity is key to allowing replication to solve a number of
problems: reliably synchronize databases between multiple machines for
redundant data storage; distribute data to a cluster of CouchDB instances
that share a subset of the total number of requests that hit the cluster
(load balancing); and distribute data between physically distant locations,
such as one office in New York and another in Tokyo.
.sp
CouchDB replication uses the same REST API all clients use. HTTP is
ubiquitous and well understood. Replication works incrementally; that is,
if during replication anything goes wrong, like dropping your network
connection, it will pick up where it left off the next time it runs. It also
only transfers data that is needed to synchronize databases.
.sp
A core assumption CouchDB makes is that things can go wrong,
like network connection troubles, and it is designed for graceful error
recovery instead of assuming all will be well. The replication system\(aqs
incremental design shows that best. The ideas behind “things that can go
wrong” are embodied in the \fI\%Fallacies of Distributed Computing\fP:

Existing tools often try to hide the fact that there is a network and that
any or all of the previous conditions don\(aqt exist for a particular system.
This usually results in fatal error scenarios when something finally goes
wrong. In contrast, CouchDB doesn\(aqt try to hide the network; it just handles
errors gracefully and lets you know when actions on your end are required.
.SS Local Data Is King
.sp
CouchDB takes quite a few lessons learned from the Web,
but there is one thing that could be improved about the Web: latency.
Whenever you have to wait for an application to respond or a website to
render, you almost always wait for a network connection that isn\(aqt as fast as
you want it at that point. Waiting a few seconds instead of milliseconds
greatly affects user experience and thus user satisfaction.
.sp
What do you do when you are offline? This happens all the time \-\- your DSL or
cable provider has issues, or your iPhone, G1, or Blackberry has no bars,
and no connectivity means no way to get to your data.
.sp
CouchDB can solve this scenario as well, and this is where scaling is
important again. This time it is scaling down. Imagine CouchDB installed on
phones and other mobile devices that can synchronize data with centrally
hosted CouchDBs when they are on a network. The synchronization is not bound
by user interface constraints like subsecond response times. It is easier to
tune for high bandwidth and higher latency than for low bandwidth and very
low latency. Mobile applications can then use the local CouchDB to fetch
data, and since no remote networking is required for that,
latency is low by default.
.sp
Can you really use CouchDB on a phone? Erlang, CouchDB\(aqs implementation
language has been designed to run on embedded devices magnitudes smaller and
less powerful than today\(aqs phones.
.SS Wrapping Up
.sp
The next document \fIintro/consistency\fP further explores the distributed
nature of CouchDB. We should have given you enough bites to whet your interest.
Let\(aqs go!
.SS Eventual Consistency
.sp
In the previous document \fIintro/why\fP, we saw that CouchDB\(aqs flexibility
allows us to evolve our data as our applications grow and change. In this topic,
we\(aqll explore how working "with the grain" of CouchDB promotes simplicity in
our applications and helps us naturally build scalable, distributed systems.
.SS Working with the Grain
.sp
A \fIdistributed system\fP is a system that operates robustly over a wide network.
A particular feature of network computing is that network links can
potentially disappear, and there are plenty of strategies for managing this
type of network segmentation. CouchDB differs from others by accepting
eventual consistency, as opposed to putting absolute consistency ahead of raw
availability, like \fI\%RDBMS\fP or \fI\%Paxos\fP\&. What these systems have in common is
an awareness that data acts differently when many people are accessing it
simultaneously. Their approaches differ when it comes to which aspects of
\fIconsistency\fP, \fIavailability\fP, or \fIpartition\fP tolerance they prioritize.
.sp
Engineering distributed systems is tricky. Many of the caveats and "gotchas"
you will face over time aren\(aqt immediately obvious. We don\(aqt have all the
solutions, and CouchDB isn\(aqt a panacea, but when you work with CouchDB\(aqs
grain rather than against it, the path of least resistance leads you to
naturally scalable applications.
.sp
Of course, building a distributed system is only the beginning. A website
with a database that is available only half the time is next to worthless.
Unfortunately, the traditional relational database approach to consistency
makes it very easy for application programmers to rely on global state,
global clocks, and other high availability no\-nos, without even realizing
that they\(aqre doing so. Before examining how CouchDB promotes scalability,
we\(aqll look at the constraints faced by a distributed system. After we\(aqve seen
the problems that arise when parts of your application can\(aqt rely on being
in constant contact with each other, we\(aqll see that CouchDB provides an
intuitive and useful way for modeling applications around high availability.
.SS The CAP Theorem
.sp
The CAP theorem describes a few different strategies for distributing
application logic across networks. CouchDB\(aqs solution uses replication to
propagate application changes across participating nodes. This is a
fundamentally different approach from consensus algorithms and relational
databases, which operate at different intersections of consistency,
availability, and partition tolerance.
.sp
The CAP theorem, shown in \fIintro/consistency\-01\fP,
identifies three distinct concerns:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBConsistency\fP:
All database clients see the same data, even with concurrent updates.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAvailability\fP:
All database clients are able to access some version of the data.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPartition tolerance\fP:
The database can be split over multiple servers.

.sp

.UNINDENT
.sp
When a system grows large enough that a single database node is unable to
handle the load placed on it, a sensible solution is to add more servers.
When we add nodes, we have to start thinking about how to partition data
between them. Do we have a few databases that share exactly the same data?
Do we put different sets of data on different database servers?
Do we let only certain database servers write data and let others handle
the reads?
.sp
Regardless of which approach we take, the one problem we\(aqll keep bumping into
is that of keeping all these database servers in sync. If you write some
information to one node, how are you going to make sure that a read request
to another database server reflects this newest information? These events
might be milliseconds apart. Even with a modest collection of database
servers, this problem can become extremely complex.
.sp
When it\(aqs absolutely critical that all clients see a consistent view of the
database, the users of one node will have to wait for any other nodes to come
into agreement before being able to read or write to the database.
In this instance, we see that availability takes a backseat to consistency.
However, there are situations where availability trumps consistency:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Each node in a system should be able to make decisions purely based on
local state. If you need to do something under high load with failures
occurring and you need to reach agreement, you\(aqre lost. If you\(aqre
concerned about scalability, any algorithm that forces you to run
agreement will eventually become your bottleneck. Take that as a given.
\(em Werner Vogels, Amazon CTO and Vice President
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If availability is a priority, we can let clients write data to one node of
the database without waiting for other nodes to come into agreement.
If the database knows how to take care of reconciling these operations between
nodes, we achieve a sort of "eventual consistency" in exchange for high
availability. This is a surprisingly applicable trade\-off for many applications.
.sp
Unlike traditional relational databases, where each action performed is
necessarily subject to database\-wide consistency checks,
CouchDB makes it really simple to build applications that sacrifice immediate
consistency for the huge performance improvements that come with simple
distribution.
.SS Local Consistency
.sp
Before we attempt to understand how CouchDB operates in a cluster,
it\(aqs important that we understand the inner workings of a single CouchDB node.
The CouchDB API is designed to provide a convenient but thin wrapper around
the database core. By taking a closer look at the structure of the database
core, we\(aqll have a better understanding of the API that surrounds it.
.SS The Key to Your Data
.sp
At the heart of CouchDB is a powerful \fIB\-tree\fP storage engine.
A B\-tree is a sorted data structure that allows for searches, insertions,
and deletions in logarithmic time. As \fIintro/consistency\-02\fP
illustrates, CouchDB uses this B\-tree storage engine for all internal data,
documents, and views. If we understand one, we will understand them all.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 2.5
[image: Anatomy of a view request]
[image]
Figure 2. Anatomy of a view request.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CouchDB uses MapReduce to compute the results of a view. MapReduce makes use
of two functions, "map" and "reduce", which are applied to each document in
isolation. Being able to isolate these operations means that view computation
lends itself to parallel and incremental computation. More important,
because these functions produce key/value pairs, CouchDB is able to insert
them into the B\-tree storage engine, sorted by key. Lookups by key,
or key range, are extremely efficient operations with a B\-tree,
described in \fIbig O\fP notation as \fBO(log N)\fP and \fBO(log N + K)\fP,
respectively.
.sp
In CouchDB, we access documents and view results by key or key range.
This is a direct mapping to the underlying operations performed on CouchDB\(aqs
B\-tree storage engine. Along with document inserts and updates,
this direct mapping is the reason we describe CouchDB\(aqs API as being a thin
wrapper around the database core.
.sp
Being able to access results by key alone is a very important restriction
because it allows us to make huge performance gains. As well as the massive
speed improvements, we can partition our data over multiple nodes,
without affecting our ability to query each node in isolation.
\fI\%BigTable\fP, \fI\%Hadoop\fP, \fI\%SimpleDB\fP, and \fI\%memcached\fP restrict object lookups
by key for  exactly these reasons.
.SS No Locking
.sp
A table in a relational database is a single data structure. If you want to
modify a table \-\- say, update a row \-\- the database system must ensure
that nobody else is trying to update that row and that nobody can read from
that row while it is being updated. The common way to handle this uses what\(aqs
known as a lock. If multiple clients want to access a table, the first client
gets the lock, making everybody else wait. When the first client\(aqs request is
processed, the next client is given access while everybody else waits,
and so on. This serial execution of requests, even when they arrived in
parallel, wastes a significant amount of your server\(aqs processing power.
Under high load, a relational database can spend more time figuring out who
is allowed to do what, and in which order, than it does doing any actual work.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP

.INDENT 3.5
Modern relational databases avoid locks by implementing MVCC under
the hood, but hide it from the end user, requiring them to coordinate
concurrent changes of single rows or fields.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Instead of locks, CouchDB uses \fIMulti\-Version Concurrency Control\fP (MVCC) to
manage concurrent access to the database. \fIintro/consistency\-03\fP
illustrates the differences between MVCC and traditional locking mechanisms.
MVCC means that CouchDB can run at full speed, all the time,
even under high load. Requests are run in parallel, making excellent use of
every last drop of processing power your server has to offer.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 2.5

.UNINDENT
.sp
Documents in CouchDB are versioned, much like they would be in a regular
version control system such as \fI\%Subversion\fP\&. If you want to change
a value in a document, you create an entire new version of that document
and save it over the old one. After doing this, you end up with two versions
of the same document, one old and one new.
.sp
How does this offer an improvement over locks? Consider a set of requests
wanting to access a document. The first request reads the document.
While this is being processed, a second request changes the document.
Since the second request includes a completely new version of the document,
CouchDB can simply append it to the database without having to wait for the
read request to finish.
.sp
When a third request wants to read the same document, CouchDB will point it
to the new version that has just been written. During this whole process,
the first request could still be reading the original version.
.sp
A read request will always see the most recent snapshot of your database at
the time of the beginning of the request.
.SS Validation
.sp
As application developers, we have to think about what sort of input we
should accept and what we should reject. The expressive power to do this type
of validation over complex data within a traditional relational database
leaves a lot to be desired. Fortunately, CouchDB provides a powerful way to
perform per\-document validation from within the database.
.sp
CouchDB can validate documents using JavaScript functions similar to those
used for MapReduce. Each time you try to modify a document,
CouchDB will pass the validation function a copy of the existing document,
a copy of the new document, and a collection of additional information,
such as user authentication details. The validation function now has the
opportunity to approve or deny the update.
.sp
By working with the grain and letting CouchDB do this for us,
we save ourselves a tremendous amount of CPU cycles that would otherwise have
been spent serializing object graphs from SQL, converting them into domain
objects, and using those objects to do application\-level validation.
.SS Distributed Consistency
.sp
Maintaining consistency within a single database node is relatively easy for
most databases. The real problems start to surface when you try to maintain
consistency between multiple database servers. If a client makes a write
operation on server \fIA\fP, how do we make sure that this is consistent with
server \fIB\fP, or \fIC\fP, or \fID\fP? For relational databases, this is a very complex
problem with entire books devoted to its solution. You could use
multi\-master, single\-master, partitioning, sharding, write\-through caches,
and all sorts of other complex techniques.
.SS Incremental Replication
.sp
CouchDB\(aqs operations take place within the context of a single document.
As CouchDB achieves eventual consistency between multiple databases by using
incremental replication you no longer have to worry about your database
servers being able to stay in constant communication. Incremental replication
is a process where document changes are periodically copied between servers.
We are able to build what\(aqs known as a \fIshared nothing\fP cluster of databases
where each node is independent and self\-sufficient, leaving no single point
of contention across the system.
.sp
Need to scale out your CouchDB database cluster? Just throw in another server.
.sp
As illustrated in \fIintro/consistency\-04\fP, with CouchDB\(aqs incremental
replication, you can synchronize your data between any two databases however
you like and whenever you like. After replication, each database is able
to work independently.
.sp
You could use this feature to synchronize database servers within a cluster
or between data centers using a job scheduler such as cron,
or you could use it to synchronize data with your laptop for offline work as
you travel. Each database can be used in the usual fashion,
and changes between databases can be synchronized later in both directions.

.sp
What happens when you change the same document in two different databases and
want to synchronize these with each other? CouchDB\(aqs replication system
comes with automatic conflict detection and resolution. When CouchDB detects
that a document has been changed in both databases, it flags this document
as being in conflict, much like they would be in a regular version control
system.
.sp
This isn\(aqt as troublesome as it might first sound. When two versions of a
document conflict during replication, the winning version is saved as the
most recent version in the document\(aqs history. Instead of throwing the losing
version away, as you might expect, CouchDB saves this as a previous version
in the document\(aqs history, so that you can access it if you need to. This
happens automatically and consistently, so both databases will make exactly
the same choice.
.sp
It is up to you to handle conflicts in a way that makes sense for your
application. You can leave the chosen document versions in place,
revert to the older version, or try to merge the two versions and save the
result.
.SS Case Study
.sp
Greg Borenstein, a friend and coworker, built a small library for converting
Songbird playlists to JSON objects and decided to store these in CouchDB as
part of a backup application. The completed software uses CouchDB\(aqs MVCC and
document revisions to ensure that Songbird playlists are backed up robustly
between nodes.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0

\fI\%Songbird\fP is a free software media player with an integrated web browser,

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Let\(aqs examine the workflow of the Songbird backup application,
first as a user backing up from a single computer, and then using Songbird to
synchronize playlists between multiple computers. We\(aqll see how document
revisions turn what could have been a hairy problem into something that \fIjust
works\fP\&.
.sp
The first time we use this backup application, we feed our playlists to the
application and initiate a backup. Each playlist is converted to a JSON
object and handed to a CouchDB database. As illustrated in
\fIintro/consistency\-05\fP, CouchDB hands back the document ID and
revision of each playlist as it\(aqs saved to the database.

Figure 5. Backing up to a single database.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After a few days, we find that our playlists have been updated and we want to
back up our changes. After we have fed our playlists to the backup
application, it fetches the latest versions from CouchDB,
along with the corresponding document revisions. When the application hands
back the new playlist document, CouchDB requires that the document revision
is included in the request.
.sp
CouchDB then makes sure that the document revision handed to it in the
request matches the current revision held in the database. Because CouchDB
updates the revision with every modification, if these two are out of sync it
suggests that someone else has made changes to the document between the time
we requested it from the database and the time we sent our updates. Making
changes to a document after someone else has modified it without first
inspecting those changes is usually a bad idea.
.sp
Forcing clients to hand back the correct document revision is the heart of
CouchDB\(aqs optimistic concurrency.
.sp
We have a laptop we want to keep synchronized with our desktop computer.
With all our playlists on our desktop, the first step is to
"restore from backup" onto our laptop. This is the first time we\(aqve done this,
so afterward our laptop  should hold an exact replica of our desktop playlist
collection.
.sp
After editing our Argentine Tango playlist on our laptop to add a few new
songs we\(aqve purchased, we want to save our changes. The backup application
replaces the playlist document in our laptop CouchDB database and a new
document revision is generated. A few days later, we remember our new songs
and want to copy the playlist across to our desktop computer. As illustrated
in \fIintro/consistency\-06\fP, the backup application copies the new document
and the new revision to the desktop CouchDB database. Both CouchDB databases
now have the same document revision.

Figure 6. Synchronizing between two databases.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Because CouchDB tracks document revisions, it ensures that updates like these
will work only if they are based on current information. If we had made
modifications to the playlist backups between synchronization,
things wouldn\(aqt go as smoothly.
.sp
We back up some changes on our laptop and forget to synchronize. A few days
later, we\(aqre editing playlists on our desktop computer, make a backup,
and want to synchronize this to our laptop. As illustrated in
\fIintro/consistency\-07\fP, when our backup application tries to replicate
between the two databases, CouchDB sees that the changes being sent from our
desktop computer are modifications of out\-of\-date documents and helpfully
informs us that there has been a conflict.
.sp
Recovering from this error is easy to accomplish from an application
perspective. Just download CouchDB\(aqs version of the playlist and provide an
opportunity to merge the changes or save local modifications into a new
playlist.

CouchDB\(aqs design borrows heavily from web architecture and the lessons
learned deploying massively distributed systems on that architecture.
By understanding why this architecture works the way it does,
and by learning to spot which parts of your application can be easily
distributed and which parts cannot, you\(aqll enhance your ability to design
distributed and scalable applications, with CouchDB or without it.

.SS Your First Database and Document
.sp
Creating a database in Fauxton is simple. From the overview page,
click "Create Database." When asked for a name, enter hello\-world and click
the Create button.
.sp
After your database has been created, Fauxton will display a list of all its
documents. This list will start out empty, so let\(aqs
create our first document. Click the plus sign next to "All Documents" and
select the "New Doc" link. CouchDB will generate a UUID for you.
.sp
For demoing purposes, having CouchDB assign a UUID is fine. When you write
your first programs, we recommend assigning your own UUIDs. If you rely on
the server to generate the UUID and you end up making two POST requests
because the first POST request bombed out, you might generate two docs and
never find out about the first one because only the second one will be
reported back. Generating your own UUIDs makes sure that you\(aqll never end up
with duplicate documents.
.sp
Fauxton will display the newly created document, with its _id field. To create
a new field, simply use the editor to write valid JSON. Add a new field by
appending a comma to the \fB_id\fP value, then adding the text:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"hello": "my new value"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Click the green Create Document button to finalize creating the
document.
.sp
You can experiment with other JSON values; e.g., \fB[1, 2, "c"]\fP or
\fB{"foo": "bar"}\fP\&.
.sp
You\(aqll notice that the document\(aqs _rev has been added. We\(aqll go into more detail
about this in later documents, but for now, the important thing to note is
that _rev acts like a safety feature when saving a document. As long as you
and CouchDB agree on the most recent _rev of a document, you can successfully
save your changes.
.sp
For clarity, you may want to display the contents of the document in the all
document view. To enable this, from the upper\-right corner of the window,
select Options, then check the Include Docs option. Finally, press the Run
Query button. The full document should be displayed along with the \fB_id\fP
and \fB_rev\fP values.
.SS Running a Query Using MapReduce
.sp
Traditional relational databases allow you to run any queries you like as
long as your data is structured correctly. In contrast,
CouchDB uses predefined map and reduce functions in a style known as
MapReduce. These functions provide great flexibility because they can adapt
to variations in document structure, and indexes for each document can be
computed independently and in parallel. The combination of a map and a reduce
function is called a view in CouchDB terminology.
.sp
For experienced relational database programmers, MapReduce can take some
getting used to. Rather than declaring which rows from which tables to
include in a result set and depending on the database to determine the most
efficient way to run the query, reduce queries are based on simple range
requests against the indexes generated by your map functions.
.sp
Map functions are called once with each document as the argument.
The function can choose to skip the document altogether or emit one or more
view rows as key/value pairs. Map functions may not depend on any information
outside of the document. This independence is what allows CouchDB views to be
generated incrementally and in parallel.
.sp
CouchDB views are stored as rows that are kept sorted by key. This makes
retrieving data from a range of keys efficient even when there are thousands
or millions of rows. When writing CouchDB map functions,
your primary goal is to build an index that stores related data under nearby
keys.
.sp
Before we can run an example MapReduce view, we\(aqll need some data to run it
on. We\(aqll create documents carrying the price of various supermarket items as
found at different shops. Let\(aqs create documents for apples, oranges,
and bananas. (Allow CouchDB to generate the _id and _rev fields.) Use Fauxton
to create documents that have a final JSON structure that looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "00a271787f89c0ef2e10e88a0c0001f4",
    "_rev": "1\-2628a75ac8c3abfffc8f6e30c9949fd6",
    "item": "apple",
    "prices": {
        "Fresh Mart": 1.59,
        "Price Max": 5.99,
        "Apples Express": 0.79
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
OK, now that that\(aqs done, let\(aqs create the document for oranges:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "00a271787f89c0ef2e10e88a0c0003f0",

    "item": "orange",
    "prices": {
        "Fresh Mart": 1.99,
        "Price Max": 3.19,
        "Citrus Circus": 1.09
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And finally, the document for bananas:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "00a271787f89c0ef2e10e88a0c00048b",

    "item": "banana",
    "prices": {
        "Fresh Mart": 1.99,
        "Price Max": 0.79,
        "Banana Montana": 4.22
    }
}
.ft P

.sp
Imagine we\(aqre catering a big luncheon, but the client is very price\-sensitive.
To find the lowest prices, we\(aqre going to create our first view,
which shows each fruit sorted by price. Click "All Documents" to return to the
hello\-world overview, and then from the "All Documents" plus sign, click "New
View" to create a new view.
.sp
Name the design document \fB_design/myDesignDoc\fP, and set the Index name
to \fBprices\fP\&.
.sp
Edit the map function, on the right, so that it looks like the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    var shop, price, value;
    if (doc.item && doc.prices) {
        for (shop in doc.prices) {
            price = doc.prices[shop];
            value = [doc.item, shop];
            emit(price, value);
        }
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is a JavaScript function that CouchDB runs for each of our documents as
it computes the view. We\(aqll leave the reduce function blank for the time being.
.sp
Click "Run" and you should see result rows,
with the various items sorted by price. This map function could be even more
useful if it grouped the items by type so that all the prices for bananas were
next to each other in the result set. CouchDB\(aqs key sorting system allows any
valid JSON object as a key. In this case, we\(aqll emit an array of [item, price]
so that CouchDB groups by item type and price.
.sp
Let\(aqs modify the view function (click the wrench icon next to the Views >
prices Design Document on the left, then select Edit) so that it looks like
this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    var shop, price, key;
    if (doc.item && doc.prices) {
        for (shop in doc.prices) {
            price = doc.prices[shop];
            key = [doc.item, price];
            emit(key, shop);
        }
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here, we first check that the document has the fields we want to use. CouchDB
recovers gracefully from a few isolated map function failures,
but when a map function fails regularly (due to a missing required field or
other JavaScript exception), CouchDB shuts off its indexing to prevent any
further resource usage. For this reason, it\(aqs important to check for the
existence of any fields before you use them. In this case,
our map function will skip the first "hello world" document we created
without emitting any rows or encountering any errors. The result of this
query should now be displayed.
.sp
Once we know we\(aqve got a document with an item type and some prices,
we iterate over the item\(aqs prices and emit key/values pairs. The key is an
array of the item and the price, and forms the basis for CouchDB\(aqs sorted
index. In this case, the value is the name of the shop where the item can be
found for the listed price.
.sp
View rows are sorted by their keys \-\- in this example, first by item,
then by price. This method of complex sorting is at the heart of creating
useful indexes with CouchDB.
.sp
MapReduce can be challenging, especially if you\(aqve spent years working with
relational databases. The important things to keep in mind are that map
functions give you an opportunity to sort your data using any key you choose,
and that CouchDB\(aqs design is focused on providing fast,
efficient access to data within a range of keys.
.SS Triggering Replication
.sp
Fauxton can trigger replication between two local databases,
between a local and remote database, or even between two remote databases.
We\(aqll show you how to replicate data from one local database to another,
which is a simple way of making backups of your databases as we\(aqre working
through the examples.
.sp
First we\(aqll need to create an empty database to be the target of replication.
Return to the Databases overview and create a database called
\fBhello\-replication\fP\&.  Now click "Replication" in the sidebar and choose
hello\-world as the source and hello\-replication as the target. Click
"Replicate" to replicate your database.
.sp
To view the result of your replication, click on the Databases tab again.
You should see the hello\-replication database has the same number of documents
as the hello\-world database, and it should take up roughly the same size as
well.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For larger databases, replication can take much longer. It is important to
leave the browser window open while replication is taking place.
As an alternative, you can trigger replication via curl or some other HTTP
client that can handle long\-running connections. If your client closes the
connection before replication finishes, you\(aqll have to retrigger it.
Luckily, CouchDB\(aqs replication can take over from where it left off
instead of starting from scratch.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Wrapping Up
.sp
Now that you\(aqve seen most of Fauxton\(aqs features, you\(aqll be prepared to dive in
and inspect your data as we build our example application in the next few
documents. Fauxton\(aqs pure JavaScript approach to managing CouchDB shows how
it\(aqs possible to build a fully featured web application using only CouchDB\(aqs
HTTP API and integrated web server.
.sp
But before we get there, we\(aqll have another look at CouchDB\(aqs HTTP API \-\- now
with a magnifying glass. Let\(aqs curl up on the couch and relax.
.SS The Core API
.sp
This document explores the CouchDB in minute detail. It shows all the
nitty\-gritty and clever bits. We show you best practices and guide you around
common pitfalls.
.sp
We start out by revisiting the basic operations we ran in the previous document
\fIintro/tour\fP, looking behind the scenes. We also show what Fauxton needs to
do behind its user interface to give us the nice features we saw earlier.
.sp
This document is both an introduction to the core CouchDB API as well as a
reference. If you can\(aqt remember how to run a particular request or why some
parameters are needed, you can always come back here and look things up (we
are probably the heaviest users of this document).
.sp
While explaining the API bits and pieces, we sometimes need to take a larger
detour to explain the reasoning for a particular request. This is a good
opportunity for us to tell you why CouchDB works the way it does.
.sp
The API can be subdivided into the following sections. We\(aqll explore them
individually:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Server\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Databases\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Documents\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Replication\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%Wrapping Up\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS Server
.sp
This one is basic and simple. It can serve as a sanity check to see if
CouchDB is running at all. It can also act as a safety guard for libraries
that require a certain version of CouchDB. We\(aqre using the \fI\%curl\fP utility
again:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
curl http://127.0.0.1:5984/
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CouchDB replies, all excited to get going:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "couchdb": "Welcome",
    "uuid": "85fb71bf700c17267fef77535820e371",
    "vendor": {
        "name": "The Apache Software Foundation",
        "version": "1.5.0"
    },
    "version": "1.5.0"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You get back a JSON string, that, if parsed into a native object or data
structure of your programming language, gives you access to the welcome
string and version information.
.sp
This is not terribly useful, but it illustrates nicely the way CouchDB
behaves. You send an HTTP request and you receive a JSON string in the HTTP
response as a result.
.SS Databases
.sp
Now let\(aqs do something a little more useful: \fIcreate databases\fP\&.
For the strict, CouchDB is a \fIdatabase management system\fP (DMS). That means it
can hold multiple databases. A database is a bucket that holds "related data".
We\(aqll explore later what that means exactly. In practice, the terminology is
overlapping \-\- often people refer to a DMS as "a database" and also a database
within the DMS as "a database." We might follow that slight oddity, so don\(aqt
get confused by it. In general, it should be clear from the context if we are
talking about the whole of CouchDB or a single database within CouchDB.
.sp
Now let\(aqs make one! We want to store our favorite music albums,
and we creatively give our database the name albums. Note that we\(aqre now
using the \fB\-X\fP option again to tell curl to send a \fI\%PUT\fP request
instead of the default \fI\%GET\fP request:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
curl \-X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/albums
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CouchDB replies:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{"ok":true}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
That\(aqs it. You created a database and CouchDB told you that all went well.
What happens if you try to create a database that already exists? Let\(aqs try
to create that database again:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
curl \-X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/albums
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CouchDB replies:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{"error":"file_exists","reason":"The database could not be created, the file already exists."}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
We get back an error. This is pretty convenient. We also learn a little bit
about how CouchDB works. CouchDB stores each database in a single file.
Very simple.
.sp
Let\(aqs create another database, this time with curl\(aqs \fB\-v\fP (for "verbose")
option. The verbose option tells curl to show us not only the essentials \-\-
the HTTP response body \-\- but all the underlying request and response details:
.INDENT 0.0

This initiates an HTTP request. Its \fImethod\fP is \fI\%PUT\fP, the \fIURI\fP is
\fB/albums\-backup\fP, and the HTTP version is \fBHTTP/1.1\fP\&. There is also
\fBHTTP/1.0\fP, which is simpler in some cases, but for all practical reasons
you should be using \fBHTTP/1.1\fP\&.
.sp
Next, we see a number of \fIrequest headers\fP\&. These are used to provide
additional details about the request to CouchDB.

The User\-Agent header tells CouchDB which piece of client software is doing
the HTTP request. We don\(aqt learn anything new: it\(aqs curl. This header is
often useful in web development when there are known errors in client
implementations that a server might want to prepare the response for.
It also helps to determine which platform a user is on. This information
can be used for technical and statistical reasons. For CouchDB, the
\fI\%User\-Agent\fP header is irrelevant.

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

An empty line denotes that the request headers are now finished and the rest

we\(aqre not sending any data, so the rest of the curl output is dedicated to
the HTTP response.
.INDENT 0.0

The first line of CouchDB\(aqs HTTP response includes the HTTP version
information (again, to acknowledge that the requested version could be
processed), an HTTP \fIstatus code\fP, and a \fIstatus code message\fP\&.
Different requests trigger different response codes. There\(aqs a whole range of
them telling the client (curl in our case) what effect the request had on the
server. Or, if an error occurred, what kind of error. \fI\%RFC 2616\fP (the HTTP 1.1
specification) defines clear behavior for response codes. CouchDB fully
follows the RFC.
.sp
The \fI\%201 Created\fP status code tells the client that the resource
the request was made against was successfully created. No surprise here,
but if you remember that we got an error message when we tried to create this
database twice, you now know that this response could include a different
response code. Acting upon responses based on response codes is a common
practice. For example, all response codes of \fI\%400 Bad Request\fP or larger
tell you that some error occurred. If you want to shortcut your logic and
immediately deal with the error, you could just check a >= \fB400\fP response
code.

The \fI\%Content\-Type\fP header tells you which MIME type
the HTTP response body is and its encoding. We already know CouchDB returns
JSON strings. The appropriate \fI\%Content\-Type\fP header is
\fIapplication/json\fP\&. Why do we see \fItext/plain\fP?
This is where pragmatism wins over purity. Sending an
\fIapplication/json\fP \fI\%Content\-Type\fP header will make
a browser offer you the returned JSON for download instead of
just displaying it. Since it is extremely useful to be able to test CouchDB
from a browser, CouchDB sends a \fItext/plain\fP content type, so all
browsers will display the JSON as text.

database contents are stored in. There is no \fI"Are you sure?"\fP safety net or
any \fI"Empty the trash"\fP magic you\(aqve got to do to delete a database. Use this
command with care. Your data will be deleted without a chance to bring it
back easily if you don\(aqt have a backup copy.
.sp
This section went knee\-deep into HTTP and set the stage for discussing the
rest of the core CouchDB API. Next stop: documents.
.SS Documents
.sp
Documents are CouchDB\(aqs central data structure. The idea behind a document
is, unsurprisingly, that of a real\-world document \-\- a sheet of paper such as
an invoice, a recipe, or a business card. We already learned that CouchDB uses
the JSON format to store documents. Let\(aqs see how this storing works at the
lowest level.
.sp
Each document in CouchDB has an \fIID\fP\&. This ID is unique per database. You are
free to choose any string to be the ID, but for best results we recommend a
\fI\%UUID\fP (or \fI\%GUID\fP), i.e., a Universally (or Globally) Unique IDentifier.
UUIDs are random numbers that have such a low collision probability that
everybody can make thousands of UUIDs a minute for millions of years without
ever creating a duplicate. This is a great way to ensure two independent people
cannot create two different documents with the same ID. Why should you care
what somebody else is doing? For one, that somebody else could be you at a
later time or on a different computer; secondly, CouchDB replication lets you
share documents with others and using UUIDs ensures that it all works.
But more on that later; let\(aqs make some documents:

The curl command appears complex, but let\(aqs break it down.
First, \fB\-X PUT\fP tells curl to make a \fI\%PUT\fP request.
It is followed by the URL that specifies your CouchDB IP address and port.
The resource part of the URL \fB/albums/6e1295ed6c29495e54cc05947f18c8af\fP
specifies the location of a document inside our albums database.
The wild collection of numbers and characters is a UUID. This UUID is your
document\(aqs ID. Finally, the \fB\-d\fP flag tells curl to use the following
string as the body for the \fI\%PUT\fP request. The string is a simple JSON
structure including \fBtitle\fP and \fBartist\fP attributes with their respective
values.

This looks a lot like the document you asked CouchDB to save, which is good.
But you should notice that CouchDB added two fields to your JSON structure.
The first is \fB_id\fP, which holds the UUID we asked CouchDB to save our document
under. We always know the ID of a document if it is included, which is very
convenient.
.sp
The second field is \fB_rev\fP\&. It stands for \fIrevision\fP\&.
.SS Revisions
.sp
If you want to change a document in CouchDB, you don\(aqt tell it to go and find
a field in a specific document and insert a new value. Instead, you load
the full document out of CouchDB, make your changes in the JSON structure
(or object, when you are doing actual programming), and save the entire new
revision (or version) of that document back into CouchDB. Each revision is
identified by a new \fB_rev\fP value.
.sp
If you want to update or delete a document, CouchDB expects you to include
the \fB_rev\fP field of the revision you wish to change. When CouchDB accepts
the change, it will generate a new revision number. This mechanism ensures that,
in case somebody else made a change without you knowing before you got to
request the document update, CouchDB will not accept your update because you
are likely to overwrite data you didn\(aqt know existed. Or simplified: whoever
saves a change to a document first, wins. Let\(aqs see what happens if we don\(aqt
provide a \fB_rev\fP field (which is equivalent to providing a outdated value):

CouchDB accepted your write and also generated a new revision number.
The revision number is the \fIMD5 hash\fP of the transport representation of a
document with an \fBN\-\fP prefix denoting the number of times a document got
updated. This is useful for replication. See \fIreplication/conflicts\fP for
more information.
.sp
There are multiple reasons why CouchDB uses this revision system,
which is also called Multi\-Version Concurrency Control (\fI\%MVCC\fP). They all work
hand\-in\-hand, and this is a good opportunity to explain some of them.
.sp
One of the aspects of the HTTP protocol that CouchDB uses is that it is
stateless. What does that mean? When talking to CouchDB you need to make
requests. Making a request includes opening a network connection to CouchDB,
exchanging bytes, and closing the connection. This is done every time you
make a request. Other protocols allow you to open a connection, exchange bytes,
keep the connection open, exchange more bytes later \-\- maybe depending on the
bytes you exchanged at the beginning \-\- and eventually close the connection.
Holding a connection open for later use requires the server to do extra work.
One common pattern is that for the lifetime of a connection, the client has
a consistent and static view of the data on the server. Managing huge amounts
of parallel connections is a significant amount of work. HTTP connections are
usually short\-lived, and making the same guarantees is a lot easier.
As a result, CouchDB can handle many more concurrent connections.
.sp
Another reason CouchDB uses MVCC is that this model is simpler conceptually
and, as a consequence, easier to program. CouchDB uses less code to make this
work, and less code is always good because the ratio of defects per lines of
code is static.
.sp
The revision system also has positive effects on replication and storage
mechanisms, but we\(aqll explore these later in the documents.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The terms \fIversion\fP and \fIrevision\fP might sound familiar (if you are
programming without version control, stop reading this guide right now and
start learning one of the popular systems). Using new versions for document
changes works a lot like version control, but there\(aqs an important
difference: \fBCouchDB does not guarantee that older versions are kept
around\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Documents in Detail
.sp
Now let\(aqs have a closer look at our document creation requests with the curl
\fB\-v\fP flag that was helpful when we explored the database API earlier.
This is also a good opportunity to create more documents that we can use in
later examples.
.sp
We\(aqll add some more of our favorite music albums. Get a fresh UUID from the
\fB/_uuids\fP resource. If you don\(aqt remember how that works, you can look it up
a few pages back.

albums, don\(aqt hesitate to add more properties. And don\(aqt worry about not
knowing all the information for all the albums. CouchDB\(aqs schema\-less
documents can contain whatever you know. After all, you should relax and not
worry about data.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now with the \fB\-v\fP option, CouchDB\(aqs reply (with only the important bits shown)
looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
We\(aqre getting back the \fI\%201 Created\fP HTTP status code in the response
headers, as we saw earlier when we created a database. The \fI\%Location\fP
header gives us a full URL to our newly created document. And there\(aqs a new
header. An \fI\%ETag\fP in HTTP\-speak identifies a specific version of a
resource. In this case, it identifies a specific version (the first one) of our
new document. Sound familiar? Yes, conceptually, an \fI\%ETag\fP is the same
as a CouchDB document revision number, and it shouldn\(aqt come as a surprise that
CouchDB uses revision numbers for ETags. ETags are useful for caching
infrastructures.
.SS Attachments
.sp
CouchDB documents can have attachments just like an email message can have
attachments. An attachment is identified by a name and includes its MIME type
(or \fI\%Content\-Type\fP) and the number of bytes the attachment
contains. Attachments can be any data. It is easiest to think about attachments
as files attached to a document. These files can be text, images, Word
documents, music, or movie files. Let\(aqs make one.
.sp
Attachments get their own URL where you can upload data. Say we want to add
the album artwork to the \fB6e1295ed6c29495e54cc05947f18c8af\fP document
(\fI"There is Nothing Left to Lose"\fP), and let\(aqs also say the artwork is in a file
\fIartwork.jpg\fP in the current directory:

The \fB\-\-data\-binary\fP \fB@\fP option tells curl to read a file\(aqs contents into
the HTTP request body. We\(aqre using the \fB\-H\fP option to tell CouchDB that
we\(aqre uploading a JPEG file. CouchDB will keep this information around and
will send the appropriate header when requesting this attachment; in case of
an image like this, a browser will render the image instead of offering you
the data for download. This will come in handy later. Note that you need
to provide the current revision number of the document you\(aqre attaching
the artwork to, just as if you would update the document. Because, after
all, attaching some data is changing the document.

.sp
We\(aqll have a look at more document request options later as we explore more
features of CouchDB, such as replication, which is the next topic.
.SS Replication
.sp
CouchDB replication is a mechanism to synchronize databases. Much like \fI\%rsync\fP
synchronizes two directories locally or over a network, replication synchronizes
two databases locally or remotely.
.sp
In a simple \fI\%POST\fP request, you tell CouchDB the \fIsource\fP and the
\fItarget\fP of a replication and CouchDB will figure out which documents and new
document revisions are on \fIsource\fP that are not yet on \fItarget\fP, and will
proceed  to move the missing documents and revisions over.
.sp
We\(aqll take an in\-depth look at replication in the document
\fIreplication/intro\fP; in this document, we\(aqll just show you how to use it.
.sp
First, we\(aqll create a target database. Note that CouchDB won\(aqt automatically
create a target database for you, and will return a replication failure if
the target doesn\(aqt exist (likewise for the source, but that mistake isn\(aqt as
easy to make):

CouchDB maintains a \fIsession history\fP of replications. The response for a
replication request contains the history entry for this \fIreplication session\fP\&.
It is also worth noting that the request for replication will stay open until
replication closes. If you have a lot of documents, it\(aqll take a while until
they are all replicated and you won\(aqt get back the replication response
until all documents are replicated. It is important to note that
replication replicates the database only as it was at the point in time
when replication was started. So, any additions, modifications,
or deletions subsequent to the start of replication will not be replicated.
.sp
We\(aqll punt on the details again \-\- the \fB"ok": true\fP at the end tells us all
went well. If you now have a look at the albums\-replica database,
you should see all the documents that you created in the albums database.
Neat, eh?
.sp
What you just did is called local replication in CouchDB terms. You created a
local copy of a database. This is useful for backups or to keep snapshots of
a specific state of your data around for later. You might want to do this
if you are developing your applications but want to be able to roll back to
a stable version of your code and data.
.sp
There are more types of replication useful in other situations. The source
and target members of our replication request are actually links (like in
HTML) and so far we\(aqve seen links relative to the server we\(aqre working on
(hence local). You can also specify a remote database as the target:

\fBCouchDB and REST\fP
.sp
CouchDB prides itself on having a \fI\%RESTful\fP API, but these replication
requests don\(aqt look very RESTy to the trained eye. What\(aqs up with that?
While CouchDB\(aqs core database, document, and attachment API are RESTful,
not all of CouchDB\(aqs API is. The replication API is one example. There are
more, as we\(aqll see later in the documents.
.sp
Why are there RESTful and non\-RESTful APIs mixed up here? Have the
developers been too lazy to go REST all the way? Remember, REST is an
architectural style that lends itself to certain architectures (such as the
CouchDB document API). But it is not a one\-size\-fits\-all. Triggering an
event like replication does not make a whole lot of sense in the REST world.
It is more like a traditional remote procedure call. And there is nothing
wrong with this.
.sp
We very much believe in the "use the right tool for the job" philosophy,
and REST does not fit every job. For support, we refer to Leonard Richardson
and Sam Ruby who wrote \fI\%RESTful Web Services\fP (O\(aqReilly), as they share our
view.

adventurous. Any rogue client could come along and delete a database.
.sp
A note of relief: by default, CouchDB will listen only on your loopback
network interface (\fB127.0.0.1\fP or \fBlocalhost\fP) and thus only you will be
able to make requests to CouchDB, nobody else. But when you start to open up
your CouchDB to the public (that is, by telling it to bind to your machine\(aqs
public IP address), you will want to think about restricting access so that
the next bad guy doesn\(aqt ruin your admin party.
.sp
In our previous discussions, we dropped some keywords about how things
without the \fIAdmin Party\fP work. First, there\(aqs \fIadmin\fP itself, which implies
some sort of super user. Then there are \fIprivileges\fP\&. Let\(aqs explore these terms
a little more.
.sp
CouchDB has the idea of an \fIadmin user\fP (e.g. an administrator, a super user,
or root) that is allowed to do anything to a CouchDB installation. By default,
everybody is an admin. If you don\(aqt like that, you can create specific admin
users with a username and password as their credentials.
.sp
CouchDB also defines a set of requests that only admin users are allowed to
do. If you have defined one or more specific admin users, CouchDB will ask for
identification for certain requests:

.SS Creating New Admin User

Let\(aqs do another walk through the API using \fIcurl\fP to see how CouchDB behaves
when you add admin users.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.sp
When starting out fresh, we can add a database. Nothing unexpected. Now let\(aqs
create an admin user. We\(aqll call her \fBanna\fP, and her password is \fBsecret\fP\&.
Note the double quotes in the following code; they are needed to denote a string
value for the \fIconfiguration API\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
> curl \-X PUT $HOST/_config/admins/anna \-d \(aq"secret"\(aq
""
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As per the \fI_config\fP API\(aqs behavior, we\(aqre getting
the previous value for the config item we just wrote. Since our admin user
didn\(aqt exist, we get an empty string.
.SS Hashing Passwords
.sp
Seeing the plain\-text password is scary, isn\(aqt it? No worries, CouchDB doesn\(aqt
show the plain\-text password anywhere. It gets hashed right away. The hash
is that big, ugly, long string that starts out with \fB\-hashed\-\fP\&.
How does that work?
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Creates a new 128\-bit UUID. This is our \fIsalt\fP\&.
.IP 2. 3
Creates a sha1 hash of the concatenation of the bytes of the plain\-text
password and the salt \fB(sha1(password + salt))\fP\&.
.IP 3. 3
Prefixes the result with \fB\-hashed\-\fP and appends \fB,salt\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To compare a plain\-text password during authentication with the stored hash,
the same procedure is run and the resulting hash is compared to the stored
hash. The probability of two identical hashes for different passwords is too
insignificant to mention (c.f. \fI\%Bruce Schneier\fP). Should the stored hash fall
into the hands of an attacker, it is, by current standards, way too inconvenient
(i.e., it\(aqd take a lot of money and time) to find the plain\-text password from
the hash.
.sp
But what\(aqs with the \fB\-hashed\-\fP prefix? When CouchDB starts up, it reads a set
of \fI\&.ini\fP files with config settings. It loads these settings into an internal
data store (not a database). The config API lets you read the current
configuration as well as change it and create new entries. CouchDB is writing
any changes back to the \fI\&.ini\fP files.
.sp
The \fI\&.ini\fP files can also be edited by hand when CouchDB is not running.
Instead of creating the admin user as we showed previously, you could have
stopped CouchDB, opened your \fIlocal.ini\fP, added \fBanna = secret\fP to the
\fBadmins\fP, and restarted CouchDB. Upon reading the new line from
\fIlocal.ini\fP, CouchDB would run the hashing algorithm and write back the hash to
\fIlocal.ini\fP, replacing the plain\-text password. To make sure CouchDB only hashes
plain\-text passwords and not an existing hash a second time, it prefixes
the hash with \fB\-hashed\-\fP, to distinguish between plain\-text passwords and
hashed passwords. This means your plain\-text password can\(aqt start with the
characters \fB\-hashed\-\fP, but that\(aqs pretty unlikely to begin with.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Since \fI1.3.0 release\fP CouchDB uses \fB\-pbkdf2\-\fP prefix
by default to sign about using \fI\%PBKDF2\fP hashing algorithm instead of
\fISHA1\fP\&.

If you have ever accessed a website or FTP server that was password\-protected,
the \fBusername:password@\fP URL variant should look familiar.
.sp
If you are security conscious, the missing \fBs\fP in \fBhttp://\fP will make you
nervous. We\(aqre sending our password to CouchDB in plain text. This is a bad
thing, right? Yes, but consider our scenario: CouchDB listens on \fB127.0.0.1\fP
on a development box that we\(aqre the sole user of. Who could possibly sniff our
password?
.sp
If you are in a production environment, however, you need to reconsider. Will
your CouchDB instance communicate over a public network? Even a LAN shared
with other collocation customers is public. There are multiple ways to secure
communication between you or your application and CouchDB that exceed the
scope of this documentation. CouchDB as of version \fI1.1.0\fP
comes with \fISSL built in\fP\&.

.SS Cookie Authentication
.sp
Basic authentication that uses plain\-text passwords is nice and convenient,
but not very secure if no extra measures are taken. It is also a very poor
user experience. If you use basic authentication to identify admins,
your application\(aqs users need to deal with an ugly, unstylable browser modal
dialog that says non\-professional at work more than anything else.
.sp
To remedy some of these concerns, CouchDB supports cookie authentication.
With cookie authentication your application doesn\(aqt have to include the ugly
login dialog that the users\(aq browsers come with. You can use a regular HTML
form to submit logins to CouchDB. Upon receipt, CouchDB will generate a
one\-time token that the client can use in its next request to CouchDB. When
CouchDB sees the token in a subsequent request, it will authenticate the user
based on the token without the need to see the password again. By default,
a token is valid for 10 minutes.
.sp
To obtain the first token and thus authenticate a user for the first time,
the username and password must be sent to the \fI_session\fP
API. The API is smart enough to decode HTML form submissions, so you don\(aqt have
to resort to any smarts in your application.
.sp
If you are not using HTML forms to log in, you need to send an HTTP request
that looks as if an HTML form generated it. Luckily, this is super simple:

A \fI\%200 OK\fP response code tells us all is well, a \fI\%Set\-Cookie\fP

sending the username and password again:

.SS Authentication Database
.sp
You may already note that CouchDB administrators are defined within the config
file and are wondering if regular users are also stored there. No, they are not.
CouchDB has a special \fIauthentication database\fP, named \fB_users\fP by default,
that stores all registered users as JSON documents.
.sp
This special database is a \fIsystem database\fP\&. This means that while it shares
the common \fIdatabase API\fP, there are some
special security\-related constraints applied. Below is a list of how the
\fIauthentication database\fP is different from the other databases.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Only administrators may browse list of all documents
(\fBGET /_users/_all_docs\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Only administrators may listen to \fIchanges feed\fP (\fBGET /_users/_changes\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
Only administrators may execute design functions like \fIviews\fP,
\fIshows\fP and \fIothers\fP
.IP \(bu 2
There is a special design document \fB_auth\fP that cannot be modified
.IP \(bu 2
Every document except the \fIdesign documents\fP represent registered
CouchDB users and belong to them
.IP \(bu 2
Users may only access (\fBGET /_users/org.couchdb.user:Jan\fP) or modify (\fBPUT /_users/org.couchdb.user:Jan\fP) documents that they own
.UNINDENT
.sp
These draconian rules are necessary since CouchDB cares about its users\(aq
personal information and will not disclose it to just anyone. Often, user
documents contain system information like \fIlogin\fP, \fIpassword hash\fP and \fIroles\fP,
apart from sensitive personal information like real name, email, phone, special
internal identifications and more. This is not information that you
want to share with the World.
.SS Users Documents
.sp
Each CouchDB user is stored in document format. These documents contain
several \fImandatory\fP fields, that CouchDB needs for authentication:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_id\fP (\fIstring\fP): Document ID. Contains user\(aqs login with special prefix
\fIorg.couchdb.user\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBderived_key\fP (\fIstring\fP): \fI\%PBKDF2\fP key
.IP \(bu 2
\fBname\fP (\fIstring\fP): User\(aqs name aka login. \fBImmutable\fP e.g. you cannot
rename an existing user \- you have to create new one
.IP \(bu 2
\fBroles\fP (\fIarray\fP of \fIstring\fP): List of user roles. CouchDB doesn\(aqt provide
any builtin roles, so you\(aqre free to define your own depending on your needs.
However, you cannot set system roles like \fB_admin\fP there. Also, only
administrators may assign roles to users \- by default all users have no roles
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpassword_sha\fP (\fIstring\fP): Hashed password with salt. Used for \fBsimple\fP
\fIpassword_scheme\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpassword_scheme\fP (\fIstring\fP): Password hashing scheme. May be \fBsimple\fP or
\fBpbkdf2\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsalt\fP (\fIstring\fP): Hash salt. Used for \fBsimple\fP \fIpassword_scheme\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtype\fP (\fIstring\fP): Document type. Constantly has the value \fBuser\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Additionally, you may specify any custom fields that relate to the target
user. This is a good place to store user\(aqs private information because only the
target user and CouchDB administrators may browse it.
.SS Why the \fBorg.couchdb.user:\fP prefix?
.sp
The reason there is a special prefix before a user\(aqs login name is to have
namespaces that users belong to. This prefix is designed to prevent
replication conflicts when you try merging two or more \fI_user\fP databases.
.sp
For current CouchDB releases, all users belong to the same
\fBorg.couchdb.user\fP namespace and this cannot be changed. This may be changed
in future releases.
.SS Creating a New User
.sp
Creating a new user is a very trivial operation. You just need to do a
\fI\%PUT\fP request with the user\(aqs data to CouchDB. Let\(aqs create a user with
login \fIjan\fP and password \fIapple\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS Password Changing
.sp
Let\(aqs define what is password changing from the point of view of CouchDB and
the authentication database. Since "users" are "documents", this operation is
just updating the document with a special field \fBpassword\fP which contains
the \fIplain text password\fP\&. Scared? No need to be. The authentication database
has a special internal hook on document update which looks for this field and
replaces it with the \fIsecured hash\fP depending on the chosen \fBpassword_scheme\fP\&.
.sp
Summarizing the above process \- we need to get the document\(aqs content, add
the \fBpassword\fP field with the new password in plain text and then store the
JSON result to the authentication database.

.SS Authorization
.sp
Now that you have a few users who can log in, you probably want to set up some
restrictions on what actions they can perform based on their identity and their
roles.  Each database on a CouchDB server can contain its own set of
authorization rules that specify which users are allowed to read and write
documents, create design documents, and change certain database configuration
parameters.  The authorization rules are set up by a server admin and can be
modified at any time.
.sp
Database authorization rules assign a user into one of two classes:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fImembers\fP, who are allowed to read all documents and create and modify any
document except for design documents.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIadmins\fP, who can read and write all types of documents, modify which users
are members or admins, and set certain per\-database configuration options.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that a database admin is not the same as a server admin \-\- the actions
of a database admin are restricted to a specific database.
.sp
When a database is first created, there are no members or admins.  HTTP
requests that have no authentication credentials or have credentials for a
normal user are treated as members, and those with server admin credentials
are treated as database admins.  To change the default permissions, you must
create a \fI_security\fP document in the database:

If Jan attempted to create a design doc, however, CouchDB would return a
401 Unauthorized error because the username "jan" is not in the list of
admin names and the \fI/_users/org.couchdb.user:jan\fP document doesn\(aqt contain
a role that matches any of the declared admin roles.  If you want to promote
Jan to an admin, you can update the security document to add \fI"jan"\fP to
the \fInames\fP array under \fIadmin\fP\&.  Keeping track of individual database
admin usernames is tedious, though, so you would likely prefer to create a
database admin role and assign that role to the \fIorg.couchdb.user:jan\fP user

.SS cURL: Your Command Line Friend
.sp
The \fBcurl\fP utility is a command line tool available on Unix, Linux,
Mac OS X and Windows and many other platforms. \fBcurl\fP provides easy
access to the HTTP protocol (among others) directly from the
command\-line and is therefore an ideal way of interacting with CouchDB
over the HTTP REST API.
.sp
For simple \fBGET\fP requests you can supply the URL of the request. For
example, to get the database information:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell> curl http://127.0.0.1:5984
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This returns the database information (formatted in the output below for
clarity):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "couchdb": "Welcome",
    "uuid": "85fb71bf700c17267fef77535820e371",
    "vendor": {
        "name": "The Apache Software Foundation",
        "version": "1.4.0"
    },
    "version": "1.4.0"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
For some URLs, especially those that include special characters such as
ampersand, exclamation mark, or question mark, you should quote the URL you
are specifying on the command line. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell> curl \(aqhttp://couchdb:5984/_uuids?count=5\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can explicitly set the HTTP command using the \fB\-X\fP command line option.
For example, when creating a database, you set the name of the database in the
URL you send using a PUT request:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell> curl \-X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/demo
{"ok":true}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
But to obtain the database information you use a \fBGET\fP request (with
the return information formatted for clarity):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell> curl \-X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/demo
{
    "compact_running" : false,
    "doc_count" : 0,
    "db_name" : "demo",
    "purge_seq" : 0,
    "committed_update_seq" : 0,
    "doc_del_count" : 0,
    "disk_format_version" : 5,
    "update_seq" : 0,
    "instance_start_time" : "1306421773496000",
    "disk_size" : 79
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For certain operations, you must specify the content type of request, which you
do by specifying the \fBContent\-Type\fP header using the \fB\-H\fP command\-line
option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell> curl \-H \(aqContent\-Type: application/json\(aq http://127.0.0.1:5984/_uuids
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can also submit \(aqpayload\(aq data, that is, data in the body of the HTTP
request using the \fB\-d\fP option. This is useful if you need to submit JSON
structures, for example document data, as part of the request. For example, to
submit a simple document to the \fBdemo\fP database:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell> curl \-H \(aqContent\-Type: application/json\(aq \e
            \-X POST http://127.0.0.1:5984/demo \e
            \-d \(aq{"company": "Example, Inc."}\(aq
{"ok":true,"id":"8843faaf0b831d364278331bc3001bd8",
 "rev":"1\-33b9fbce46930280dab37d672bbc8bb9"}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the above example, the argument after the \fB\-d\fP option is the JSON of the
document we want to submit.
.sp
The document can be accessed by using the automatically generated document ID
that was returned:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell> curl \-X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/demo/8843faaf0b831d364278331bc3001bd8
{"_id":"8843faaf0b831d364278331bc3001bd8",

The API samples in the \fIapi/basics\fP show the HTTP command, URL and any
payload information that needs to be submitted (and the expected return value).

examples shown above.

.SS Runtime Errors
.SS Lots of memory being used on startup
.sp
Is your CouchDB using a lot of memory (several hundred MB) on startup? This one
seems to especially affect Dreamhost installs. It\(aqs really an issue with the
Erlang VM pre\-allocating data structures when ulimit is very large or
unlimited. A detailed dicussion can be found on the erlang\-questions list,
but the short answer is that you should decrease \fBulimit \-n\fP or define
\fBERL_MAX_PORTS\fP to something reasonable like 1024.
.SS erlang stack trace contains \fBsystem_limit\fP, \fBopen_port\fP
.sp
Erlang has a default limit of 1024 ports, where each FD, tcp connection, and
linked\-in driver uses one port. You seem to have exceeded this. You can
change it at runtime using the \fBERL_MAX_PORTS\fP env variable.
.SS function raised exception (Cannot encode \(aqundefined\(aq value as JSON)
.sp
If you see this in the CouchDB error logs, the JavaScript code you are using
for either a map or reduce function is referencing an object member that is
not defined in at least one document in your database. Consider this
document:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
  "_id":"XYZ123",
  "_rev":"1BB2BB",
  "field":"value"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and this map function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
  emit(doc.name, doc.address);
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will fail on the above document, as it does not contain a \fBname\fP or
\fBaddress\fP member. Instead, use guarding to make sure the function only
accesses members when they exist in a document:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
  if(doc.name && doc.address) {
    emit(doc.name, doc.address);
  }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
While the above guard will work in most cases, it\(aqs worth bearing JavaScript\(aqs
understanding of \(aqfalse\(aq values in mind. Testing against a property with a
value of 0 (zero), \fB\(aq\(aq\fP (empty String), \fBfalse\fP or \fBnull\fP will return
false. If this is undesired, a guard of the form \fBif (doc.foo !== undefined)\fP
should do the trick.
.sp
This error can also be caused if a reduce function does not return a value. For
example, this reduce function will cause an error:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(key, values) {
  sum(values);
}
.ft P

.UNINDENT

.SS erlang stack trace contains \fBbad_utf8_character_code\fP
.sp
CouchDB 1.1.1 and later contains stricter handling of UTF8 encoding. If you are
replicating from older versions to newer versions, then this error may occur
during replication.
.sp
A number of work\-arounds exist; the simplest is to do an in\-place upgrade of
the relevant CouchDB and then compact prior to replicating.
.sp
Alternatively, if the number of documents impacted is small, use filtered
replication to exclude only those documents.
.SS Single Node Setup
.sp
CouchDB 2.0 can be used in a single\-node and cluster setup
configuration. A single\-node CouchDB 2.0 installation is what most
users will be using. It is roughly equivalent to the CouchDB
1.x\-series. Note that a single\-node setup obviously doesn\(aqt take any
advantage of the new scaling and fault\-tolerance features in CouchDB
2.0.
.sp
After installation and initial startup, visit Fauxton at
\fBhttp://127.0.0.01:5984/_utils#setup\fP\&. You will be asked to set up
CouchDB as a single\-node instance or set up a cluster.
.sp
When you click “Single\-Node\-Setup”, you will get asked for an admin
username and password. Choose them well and remember them. You can also
bind CouchDB to a public port, so it is accessible within your LAN or
the public, if you are doing this on a public VM.
.sp
When you run 2.0 as a single node, it doesn\(aqt create system databases
on startup. You have to do this manually:

.SS Configuration files
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The following section covering load order of config files applies only to
UNIX\-ish systems. For Windows, only the provided \fBdefault.ini\fP and
\fBlocal.ini\fP files are relevant. These can of course have content
appended, which achieves the same type of functionality as outlined for
UNIX\-ish systems below.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, CouchDB reads configuration files from the following locations,
in the following order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
\fBLOCALCONFDIR/default.ini\fP
.IP 2. 3
\fBLOCALCONFDIR/default.d/*.ini\fP
.IP 3. 3
\fBPLUGINS_DIR/*/priv/default.d/*.ini\fP
.IP 4. 3
\fBLOCALCONFDIR/local.ini\fP
.IP 5. 3
\fBLOCALCONFDIR/local.d/*.ini\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBLOCALCONFDIR\fP points to the directory that contains configuration files
(\fB/usr/local/etc/couchdb\fP by default). This variable may vary from the
target operation system and may be changed during building from the source
code. For binary distributions, it mostly points to the installation path
(e.g. \fBC:\eProgram Files\eCouchDB\eetc\ecouchdb\fP for Windows).
.sp
To see the actual configuration files chain run in shell:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

Settings in successive documents override the settings in earlier entries.
For example, setting the \fBhttpd/bind_address\fP parameter in
\fBlocal.ini\fP would override any setting in \fBdefault.ini\fP\&.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

re\-installation, so localised changes should be made to the \fBlocal.ini\fP
file or files within the \fBlocal.d\fP directory.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

The configuration files chain may be changed by specifying additional sources
by using next command line options:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-a\fP: adds configuration file to the chain
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-A\fP: adds configuration directory to the chain

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In case when \fI/home/couchdb/custom.ini\fP exists it will be added to
the configuration chain.
.SS Parameter names and values
.sp
All parameter names are \fIcase\-sensitive\fP\&. Every parameter takes a value of one
of five types: \fIboolean\fP, \fIinteger\fP, \fIstring\fP, \fI\%tuple\fP and \fI\%proplist\fP\&.
Boolean values can be written as \fBtrue\fP or \fBfalse\fP\&.
.sp
Parameters with value type of \fItuple\fP or \fIproplist\fP are following the Erlang
requirement for style and naming.
.SS Setting parameters via the configuration file
.sp
The common way to set some parameters is to edit the \fIlocal.ini\fP file which is
mostly located in the \fIetc/couchdb\fP directory relative your installation path
root.
.sp
For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
; This is a comment
[section]
param = value ; inline comments are allowed
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each configuration file line may contains \fIsection\fP definition, \fIparameter\fP
specification, empty (space and newline characters only) or \fIcommented\fP line.
You can set up \fIinline\fP commentaries for \fIsections\fP or \fIparameters\fP\&.
.sp
The \fIsection\fP defines group of parameters that are belongs to some specific
CouchDB subsystem. For instance, \fBhttpd\fP section holds not only HTTP
server parameters, but also others that directly interacts with it.
.sp
The \fIparameter\fP specification contains two parts divided by the \fIequal\fP sign
(\fB=\fP): the parameter name on the left side and the parameter value on the
right one. The leading and following whitespace for \fB=\fP is an optional to
improve configuration readability.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
In case when you\(aqd like to remove some parameter from the \fIdefault.ini\fP
without modifying that file, you may override in \fIlocal.ini\fP, but without
any value:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[httpd_global_handlers]
_all_dbs =
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This could be read as: "remove the \fI_all_dbs\fP parameter from the
\fIhttpd_global_handlers\fP section if it was ever set before".
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The semicolon (\fB;\fP) signs about \fIcommentary\fP start: everything after this
character is counted as commentary and doesn\(aqt process by CouchDB.
.sp
After editing of configuration file CouchDB server instance should be restarted
to apply these changes.
.SS Setting parameters via the HTTP API
.sp
Alternatively, configuration parameters could be set via the
\fIHTTP API\fP\&. This API allows to change CouchDB configuration
on\-the\-fly without requiring a server restart:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
curl \-X PUT http://localhost:5984/_config/uuids/algorithm \-d \(aq"random"\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the response the old parameter\(aqs value returns:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"sequential"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You should be careful with changing configuration via the HTTP API since it\(aqs
easy to make CouchDB unavailable. For instance, if you\(aqd like to change the
\fBhttpd/bind_address\fP for a new one:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
curl \-X PUT http://localhost:5984/_config/httpd/bind_address \-d \(aq"10.10.0.128"\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
However, if you make a typo, or the specified IP address is not available
from your network, CouchDB will be unavailable for you in both cases and
the only way to resolve this will be by remoting into the server, correcting
the errant file, and restarting CouchDB. To protect yourself against such
accidents you may set the \fBhttpd/config_whitelist\fP of permitted
configuration parameters for updates via the HTTP API. Once this option is set,
further changes to non\-whitelisted parameters must take place via the
configuration file, and in most cases, also requires a server restart before
hand\-edited options take effect.

error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html

curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
bundle file isn\(aqt adequate, you can specify an alternate file
using the \-\-cacert option.
If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
not match the domain name in the URL).
If you\(aqd like to turn off curl\(aqs verification of the certificate, use
the \-k (or \-\-insecure) option.

New in version 1.3: added CORS support, see JIRA \fI\%COUCHDB\-431\fP

.sp
\fICORS\fP, or "Cross\-Origin Resource Sharing", allows a resource such as a web
page running JavaScript inside a browser, to make AJAX requests
(XMLHttpRequests) to a different domain, without compromising the security
of either party.
.sp
A typical use case is to have a static website hosted on a CDN make
requests to another resource, such as a hosted CouchDB instance. This
avoids needing an intermediary proxy, using \fIJSONP\fP or similar workarounds
to retrieve and host content.
.sp
While CouchDB\(aqs integrated HTTP server has support for document attachments
makes this less of a constraint for pure CouchDB projects, there are many
cases where separating the static content from the database access is
desirable, and CORS makes this very straightforward.
.sp
By supporting CORS functionality, a CouchDB instance can accept direct
connections to protected databases and instances, without the browser
functionality being blocked due to same\-origin constraints. CORS is
supported today on over 90% of recent browsers.
.sp
CORS support is provided as experimental functionality in 1.3, and as such
will need to be enabled specifically in CouchDB\(aqs configuration. While all
origins are forbidden from making requests by default, support is available
for simple requests, preflight requests and per\-vhost configuration.

.SS Per Virtual Host Configuration
.sp
To set the options for a \fBvhosts\fP, you will need to create a section
with the vhost name prefixed by \fBcors:\fP\&. Example case for the vhost
\fIexample.com\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[cors:example.com]
credentials = false
; List of origins separated by a comma

.SS Virtual Hosts
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B [vhosts]
CouchDB can map requests to different locations based on the \fBHost\fP
header, even if they arrive on the same inbound IP address.
.sp
This allows different virtual hosts on the same machine to map to different
databases or design documents, etc. The most common use case is to map a
virtual host to a \fIRewrite Handler\fP, to provide
full control over the application\(aqs URIs.
.sp
To add a virtual host, add a \fICNAME\fP pointer to the DNS for your domain
name. For development and testing, it is sufficient to add an entry in the
hosts file, typically \fI/etc/hosts\(ga\fP on Unix\-like operating systems:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# CouchDB vhost definitions, refer to local.ini for further details
127.0.0.1       couchdb.local
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Test that this is working:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ ping \-n 2 couchdb.local
PING couchdb.local (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=0.025 ms
64 bytes from localhost (127.0.0.1): icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=0.051 ms
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, add an entry to your \fIconfiguration file\fP in the
\fB[vhosts]\fP section:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[vhosts]
couchdb.local:5984 = /example
*.couchdb.local:5984 = /example
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If your CouchDB is listening on the the default HTTP port (80), or is
sitting behind a proxy, then you don\(aqt need to specify a port number in the
\fIvhost\fP key.
.sp
The first line will rewrite the request to display the content of the
\fIexample\fP database. This rule works only if the \fBHost\fP header is
\fBcouchdb.local\fP and won\(aqt work for \fICNAMEs\fP\&. The second rule, on the
other hand, matches all \fICNAMEs\fP to \fIexample\fP db, so that both
\fIwww.couchdb.local\fP and \fIdb.couchdb.local\fP will work.
.UNINDENT
.SS Rewriting Hosts to a Path
.sp
Like in the \fI_rewrite\fP handler you can match some
variable and use them to create the target path. Some examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[vhosts]
*.couchdb.local = /*
:dbname. = /:dbname
:ddocname.:dbname.example.com = /:dbname/_design/:ddocname/_rewrite
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The first rule passes the wildcard as \fIdbname\fP\&. The second one does the same,
but uses a variable name. And the third one allows you to use any URL with
\fIddocname\fP in any database with \fIdbname\fP\&.
.sp
You could also change the default function to handle request by changing the
setting \fBhttpd/redirect_vhost_handler\fP\&.
.SS Authentication and Authorization
.SS Server Administrators
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B [admins]
A default CouchDB install provides admin\-level access to all connecting
users. This configuration is known as \fIAdmin Party\fP, and is not recommended
for in\-production usage. You can crash the party simply by creating the
first admin account. CouchDB server administrators and passwords are not
stored in the \fB_users\fP database, but in the \fBlocal.ini\fP file, which
should be appropriately secured and readable only by system
administrators:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[admins]
;admin = mysecretpassword
admin = \-hashed\-6d3c30241ba0aaa4e16c6ea99224f915687ed8cd,7f4a3e05e0cbc6f48a0035e3508eef90

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Administrators can be added directly to the \fB[admins]\fP section, and when
CouchDB is restarted, the passwords will be salted and encrypted. You may
also use the HTTP interface to create administrator accounts; this way,
you don\(aqt need to restart CouchDB, and there\(aqs no need to temporarily store
or transmit passwords in plaintext. The HTTP \fB_config/admins\fP endpoint
supports querying, deleting or creating new admin accounts:

Due to security restrictions, the Erlang query server is disabled by

.sp
Unlike the JavaScript query server, the Erlang one does not runs in a
sandbox mode. This means that Erlang code has full access to your OS,
filesystem and network, which may lead to security issues. While Erlang
functions are faster than JavaScript ones, you need to be careful
about running them, especially if they were written by someone else.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

CouchDB has a native Erlang query server, allowing you to write your
map/reduce functions in Erlang.

.sp
.nf
.ft C
[native_query_servers]
erlang = {couch_native_process, start_link, []}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To see these changes you will also need to restart the server.
.sp
Let\(aqs try an example of map/reduce functions which count the total
documents at each number of revisions (there are x many documents at
version "1", and y documents at "2"... etc). Add a few documents to the
database, then enter the following functions as a view:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
%% Map Function
fun({Doc}) \->
    <<K,_/binary>> = proplists:get_value(<<"_rev">>, Doc, null),
    V = proplists:get_value(<<"_id">>, Doc, null),
    Emit(<<K>>, V)
end.

%% Reduce Function
fun(Keys, Values, ReReduce) \-> length(Values) end.
.ft P

If all has gone well, after running the view you should see a list of the

.B [os_daemons]
This is a simple feature that allows users to configure CouchDB so that it
maintains a given OS level process alive. If the process dies for any
reason, CouchDB will restart it. If the process restarts too often, then
CouchDB will mark it has halted and not attempt to restart it. The default
max restart rate is \fB3\fP times in the last \fB5\fP seconds. These parameters
are \fBadjustable\fP\&.
.sp
Commands that are started in this manner will have access to a simple API
over stdio to request configuration parameters or to add log statements to
CouchDB\(aqs logs.
.sp
To configure an OS process as a CouchDB os_daemon, create a section in your
\fIlocal.ini\fP like such:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[os_daemons]
daemon_name = /path/to/command \-with args
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will make CouchDB bring up the command and attempt to keep it alive.
To request a configuration parameter, an \fIos_daemon\fP can write a simple
JSON message to stdout like such:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["get", "os_daemons"]\en
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

which would return:
.INDENT 7.0

.nf
.ft C

.fi
.UNINDENT

.sp
.nf
.ft C

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"/path/to/command \-with args"\en
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There\(aqs no restriction on what configuration variables are visible. There\(aqs
also no method for altering the configuration.
.sp
If you would like your OS daemon to be restarted in the event that the
configuration changes, you can send the following messages:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["register", $(SECTION)]\en
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When anything in that section changes, your OS process will be rebooted so
it can pick up the new configuration settings. If you want to listen for
changes on a specific key, you can send something like:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["register", $(SECTION), $(KEY)]\en
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case, CouchDB will only restart your daemon if that exact
section/key pair changes, instead of anything in that entire section.
.sp
Logging commands look like:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["log", $(JSON_MESSAGE)]\en
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Where \fB$(JSON_MESSAGE)\fP is arbitrary JSON data. These messages are logged
at the \(aqinfo\(aq level. If you want to log at a different level you can pass
messages like such:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["log", $(JSON_MESSAGE), {"level": $(LEVEL)}]\en
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Where \fB$(LEVEL)\fP is one of "debug", "info", or "error".
.sp
When implementing a daemon process to be managed by CouchDB you should
remember to use a method like checking the parent process id or if stdin
has been closed. These flags can tell you if your daemon process has been
orphaned so you can exit cleanly.
.sp
There is no interactivity between CouchDB and the running process, but you
can use the OS Daemons service to create new HTTP servers and responders
and then use the new proxy service to redirect requests and output to the
CouchDB managed service. For more information on proxying, see

\fBImpact of UUID choices:\fP the choice of UUID has a significant
impact on the layout of the B\-tree, prior to compaction.
.sp
For example, using a sequential UUID algorithm while uploading a
large batch of documents will avoid the need to rewrite many
intermediate B\-tree nodes. A random UUID algorithm may require
rewriting intermediate nodes on a regular basis, resulting in
significantly decreased throughput and wasted disk space space due to
the append\-only B\-tree design.
.sp
It is generally recommended to set your own UUIDs, or use the
sequential algorithm unless you have a specific need and take into
account the likely need for compaction to re\-balance the B\-tree and
reclaim wasted space.

.SS Proxying Configuration
.SS CouchDB As Proxy
.sp
The HTTP proxy feature makes it easy to map and redirect different content
through your CouchDB URL. The proxy works by mapping a pathname and passing all
content after that prefix through to the configured proxy address.
.sp
Configuration of the proxy redirect is handled through the
\fB[httpd_global_handlers]\fP section of the CouchDB configuration file
(typically \fBlocal.ini\fP). The format is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[httpd_global_handlers]
PREFIX = {couch_httpd_proxy, handle_proxy_req, <<"DESTINATION">>}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

Where:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPREFIX\fP
.sp
Is the string that will be matched. The string can be any valid qualifier,
although to ensure that existing database names are not overridden by a proxy
configuration, you can use an underscore prefix.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDESTINATION\fP
.sp
The fully\-qualified URL to which the request should be sent. The destination
must include the \fBhttp\fP prefix. The content is used verbatim in the
original request, so you can also forward to servers on different ports and
to specific paths on the target host.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The proxy process then translates requests of the form:
.INDENT 0.0

The proxy service is basic. If the request is not identified by the
\fBDESTINATION\fP, or the remainder of the \fBPATH\fP specification is
incomplete, the original request URL is interpreted as if the
\fBPREFIX\fP component of that URL does not exist.
.sp
For example, requesting \fBhttp://couchdb:5984/_intranet/media\fP when
\fB/media\fP on the proxy destination does not exist, will cause the request
URL to be interpreted as \fBhttp://couchdb:5984/media\fP\&. Care should be
taken to ensure that both requested URLs and destination URLs are able to
cope.

.SH REPLICATION
.sp
The replication is an incremental one way process involving two databases
(a source and a destination).
.sp
The aim of the replication is that at the end of the process, all active
documents on the source database are also in the destination database and all
documents that were deleted in the source databases are also deleted (if exists)
on the destination database.
.sp
The replication process only copies the last revision of a document, so all
previous revisions that were only on the source database are not copied to the
destination database.
.SS Introduction to Replication
.sp
One of CouchDB\(aqs strengths is the ability to synchronize two copies of the same
database. This enables users to distribute data across several nodes or
datacenters, but also to move data more closely to clients.
.sp
Replication involves a source and a destination database, which can be on the
same or on different CouchDB instances. The aim of the replication is that at
the end of the process, all active documents on the source database are also in
the destination database and all documents that were deleted in the source
databases are also deleted on the destination database (if they even existed).
.SS Triggering Replication
.sp
Replication is controlled through documents in the
\fI_replicator\fP database, where each document describes one
replication process (see \fIreplication\-settings\fP).
.sp
A replication is triggered by storing a replication document in the replicator
database. Its status can be inspected through the active tasks API (see
\fIapi/server/active_tasks\fP and \fIreplication\-status\fP). A replication can
be stopped by deleting the document, or by updating it with its \fIcancel\fP
property set to \fItrue\fP\&.
.SS Replication Procedure
.sp
During replication, CouchDB will compare the source and the destination
database to determine which documents differ between the source and the
destination database. It does so by following the \fIchanges\fP on the source
and comparing the documents to the destination. Changes are submitted to the
destination in batches where they can introduce conflicts. Documents that
already exist on the destination in the same revision are not transferred. As
the deletion of documents is represented by a new revision, a document deleted
on the source will also be deleted on the target.
.sp
A replication task will finish once it reaches the end of the changes feed. If
its \fIcontinuous\fP property is set to true, it will wait for new changes to
appear until the task is cancelled. Replication tasks also create checkpoint
documents on the destination to ensure that a restarted task can continue from
where it stopped, for example after it has crashed.
.sp
When a replication task is initiated on the sending node, it is called \fIpush\fP
replication, if it is initiated by the receiving node, it is called \fIpull\fP
replication.
.SS Master \- Master replication
.sp
One replication task will only transfer changes in one direction. To achieve
master\-master replication, it is possible to set up two replication tasks in
opposite direction. When a change is replicated from database A to B by the
first task, the second task from B to A will discover that the new change on
B already exists in A and will wait for further changes.
.SS Controlling which Documents to Replicate
.sp
There are two ways for controlling which documents are replicated, and which
are skipped. \fILocal\fP documents are never replicated (see \fIapi/local\fP).
.sp
Additionally, \fIfilterfun\fP can be used in a replication (see
\fIreplication\-settings\fP). The replication task will then evaluate
the filter function for each document in the changes feed. The document will
only be replicated if the filter returns \fItrue\fP\&.
.SS Migrating Data to Clients
.sp
Replication can be especially useful for bringing data closer to clients.
\fI\%PouchDB\fP implements the replication algorithm of CouchDB
in JavaScript, making it possible to make data from a CouchDB database
available in an offline browser application, and synchronize changes back to
CouchDB.
.SS CouchDB Replication Protocol
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Version
3
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fICouchDB Replication Protocol\fP is a protocol for synchronising JSON
documents between 2 peers over HTTP/1.1 by using the public \fICouchDB REST
API\fP and is based on the Apache CouchDB \fI\%MVCC\fP Data model.
.SS Preface
.SS Language
.sp
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in \fI\%RFC 2119\fP\&.
.SS Goals
.sp
The primary goal of this specification is to describe the \fICouchDB Replication
Protocol\fP under the hood.
.sp
The secondary goal is to provide enough detailed information about the protocol
to make it easy to build tools on any language and platform that can synchronize
data with CouchDB.
.SS Definitions

.SS Replication Protocol Algorithm
.sp
The \fICouchDB Replication Protocol\fP is not \fImagical\fP, but
an agreement on usage of the public \fICouchDB HTTP REST API\fP to
enable Documents to be replicated from Source to Target.
.sp
The reference implementation, written in \fI\%Erlang\fP, is provided by the
\fI\%couch_replicator\fP module in Apache CouchDB.
.sp
It is RECOMMENDED that one follow this algorithm specification, use the same
HTTP endpoints, and run requests with the same parameters to provide a
completely compatible implementation. Custom Replicator implementations MAY use
different HTTP API endpoints and request parameters depending on their local
specifics and they MAY implement only part of the Replication Protocol to run
only Push or Pull Replication. However, while such solutions could also run the
Replication process, they loose compatibility with the CouchDB Replicator.

The Replicator retrieves basic information both from Source and Target using
\fBGET /{db}\fP requests. The GET response MUST contain JSON objects with
the following mandatory fields:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBinstance_start_time\fP (\fIstring\fP): Timestamp when the Database was
opened, expressed in \fImicroseconds\fP since the epoch.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBupdate_seq\fP (\fInumber\fP / \fIstring\fP): The current database Sequence ID.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any other fields are optional. The information that the Replicator needs
is the \fBupdate_seq\fP field: this value will be used to define a \fItemporary\fP
(because Database data is subject to change) upper bound for changes feed
listening and statistic calculating to show proper Replication progress.

.SS Generate Replication ID
.sp
Before Replication is started, the Replicator MUST generate a Replication ID.
This value is used to track Replication History, resume and continue previously
interrupted Replication process.
.sp
The Replication ID generation algorithm is implementation specific. Whatever
algorithm is used it MUST uniquely identify the Replication process. CouchDB\(aqs
Replicator, for example, uses the following factors in generating a Replication
ID:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Persistent Peer UUID value. For CouchDB, the local
\fBServer UUID\fP is used
.IP \(bu 2
Source and Target URI and if Source or Target are local or remote Databases
.IP \(bu 2
If Target needed to be created
.IP \(bu 2
If Replication is Continuous
.IP \(bu 2
OAuth headers if any

.SS Listen to Changes Feed
.sp
When the start up Checkpoint has been defined, the Replicator SHOULD read
the Source\(aqs \fIChanges Feed\fP by using a \fBGET /{db}/_changes\fP
request. This request MUST be made with the following query parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfeed\fP parameter defines the Changes Feed response style: for Continuous
Replication the \fBcontinuous\fP value SHOULD be used, otherwise \- \fBnormal\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBstyle=all_docs\fP query parameter tells the Source that it MUST include
all Revision leaves for each document\(aqs event in output.
.IP \(bu 2
For Continuous Replication the \fBheartbeat\fP parameter defines the heartbeat
period in \fImilliseconds\fP\&. The RECOMMENDED value by default is \fB10000\fP
(10 seconds).
.IP \(bu 2
If a startup Checkpoint was found during the Replication Logs comparison,
the \fBsince\fP query parameter MUST be passed with this value.
In case of Full Replication it MAY be \fB0\fP (number zero) or
be omitted.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Additionally, the \fBfilter\fP query parameter MAY be specified to enable a
\fIfilter function\fP on Source side. Other
custom parameters MAY also be provided.
.SS Read Batch of Changes
.sp
Reading the whole feed in a single shot may not be an optimal use of resources.
It is RECOMMENDED to process the feed in small chunks. However, there is
no specific recommendation on chunk size since it is heavily dependent on
available resources: large chunks requires more memory while they reduce
I/O operations and vice versa.
.sp
Note, that Changes Feed output format is different for a request with
\fIfeed=normal\fP and with
\fIfeed=continuous\fP query parameter.

.SS Fetch Changed Documents
.sp
At this step the Replicator MUST fetch all Document Leaf Revisions from Source
that are missed at Target. This operation is effective if Replication WILL
use previously calculated Revision differences since they define
missing Documents and their Revisions.
.sp
To fetch the Document the Replicator will make a \fBGET /{db}/{docid}\fP request
with the following query parameters:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBrevs=true\fP: Instructs the Source to include the list of all known revisions
into the Document in the \fB_revisions\fP field. This information is needed to
synchronize the Document\(aqs ancestors history between Source and Target
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBopen_revs\fP query parameter contains a JSON array with a list of
Leaf Revisions that are needed to be fetched. If the specified Revision
exists then the Document MUST be returned for this Revision. Otherwise,
Source MUST return an object with the single field \fBmissing\fP with the
missed Revision as the value. In case the Document contains attachments,
Source MUST return information only for those ones that had been changed
(added or updated) since the specified Revision values. If an attachment
was deleted, the Document MUST NOT have stub information for it
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlatest=true\fP: Ensures, that Source will return the latest Document Revision
regardless of which one was specified in the \fBopen_revs\fP query parameter.
This parameter solves a race condition problem where the requested Document
may be changed in between this step and handling related events on the
Changes Feed
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the response Source SHOULD return \fImultipart/mixed\fP or respond
instead with \fIapplication/json\fP unless the \fI\%Accept\fP header
specifies a different mime type. The \fImultipart/mixed\fP content type
allows handling the response data as a stream, since there could be multiple
documents (one per each Leaf Revision) plus several attachments. These
attachments are mostly binary and JSON has no way to handle such data except as
base64 encoded strings which are very ineffective for transfer and processing
operations.
.sp
With a \fImultipart/mixed\fP response the Replicator handles multiple
Document Leaf Revisions and their attachments one by one as raw data without
any additional encoding applied. There is also one agreement to make data
processing more effective: the Document ALWAYS goes before its attachments, so
the Replicator has no need to process all the data to map related
Documents\-Attachments and may handle it as stream with lesser memory footprint.

After receiving the response, the Replicator puts all the received data into a
local stack for further bulk upload to utilize network bandwidth effectively.
The local stack size could be limited by number of Documents or bytes of
handled JSON data. When the stack is full the Replicator uploads all the
handled Document in bulk mode to the Target. While bulk operations are highly
RECOMMENDED to be used, in certain cases the Replicator MAY upload Documents to
Target one by one.

.SS Continue Reading Changes
.sp
Once a batch of changes had been processed and transferred to Target
successfully, the Replicator can continue to listen to the Changes Feed for new
changes. If there are no new changes to process the Replication is considered
to be done.
.sp
For Continuous Replication, the Replicator MUST continue to wait for new changes
from Source.
.SS Protocol Robustness
.sp
Since the \fICouchDB Replication Protocol\fP works on top of HTTP, which is based on
TCP/IP, the Replicator SHOULD expect to be working within an unstable
environment with delays, losses and other bad surprises that might eventually
occur. The Replicator SHOULD NOT count every HTTP request failure as a \fIfatal
error\fP\&. It SHOULD be smart enough to detect timeouts, repeat failed requests,
be ready to process incomplete or malformed data and so on. \fIData must flow\fP
\- that\(aqs the rule.
.SS Error Responses
.sp
In case something goes wrong the Peer MUST respond with a JSON object with
the following REQUIRED fields:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBerror\fP (\fIstring\fP): Error type for programs and developers
.IP \(bu 2
\fBreason\fP (\fIstring\fP): Error description for humans
.UNINDENT
.SS Bad Request
.sp
If a request contains malformed data (like invalid JSON) the Peer MUST respond

.IP \(bu 2
Use continuous sessions (cookies, etc.) to reduce authentication overhead
.IP \(bu 2
Try to use bulk requests for every operations with Documents
.IP \(bu 2
Find out optimal batch size for Changes feed processing

.SS Replicator Database
.sp
The \fB_replicator\fP database works like any other in CouchDB, but documents
added to it will trigger replications. Create (\fBPUT\fP or \fBPOST\fP) a document
to start replication. \fBDELETE\fP a replication document to cancel an ongoing
replication.
.sp
These documents have exactly the same content as the JSON objects we used to
\fBPOST\fP to \fB_replicate\fP (fields \fBsource\fP, \fBtarget\fP, \fBcreate_target\fP,
\fBcontinuous\fP, \fBdoc_ids\fP, \fBfilter\fP, \fBquery_params\fP, \fBuse_checkpoints\fP,
\fBcheckpoint_interval\fP).
.sp
Replication documents can have a user defined \fB_id\fP (handy for finding a
specific replication request later). Design Documents (and \fB_local\fP documents)
added to the replicator database are ignored.
.sp
The default name of this database is \fB_replicator\fP\&. Additional replicator
databases can be created. To be recognized as such by the system, their database
names should end with \fB/_replicator\fP\&.

When you PUT/POST a document to the \fB_replicator\fP database, CouchDB
will attempt to start the replication up to 10 times (configurable under

fails on the first attempt, it waits 5 seconds before doing a second
attempt. If the second attempt fails, it waits 10 seconds before doing a

never get their state set to \fBcompleted\fP\&.
.SS Documents describing the same replication
.sp
Lets suppose 2 documents are added to the \fB_replicator\fP database in
the following order:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "doc_A",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "http://user:pass@localhost:5984/bar"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "doc_B",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "http://user:pass@localhost:5984/bar"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Both describe exactly the same replication (only their \fB_ids\fP differ). In this
case document \fBdoc_A\fP triggers the replication, getting updated by CouchDB
with the fields \fB_replication_state\fP, \fB_replication_state_time\fP and
\fB_replication_id\fP, just like it was described before. Document \fBdoc_B\fP
however, is only updated with one field, the \fB_replication_id\fP so it will
look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "doc_B",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "http://user:pass@localhost:5984/bar",
    "_replication_id":  "c0ebe9256695ff083347cbf95f93e280"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
While document \fBdoc_A\fP will look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "doc_A",
    "source":  "http://myserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "http://user:pass@localhost:5984/bar",
    "_replication_id":  "c0ebe9256695ff083347cbf95f93e280",
    "_replication_state":  "triggered",
    "_replication_state_time":  1297974122
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that both document get exactly the same value for the \fB_replication_id\fP
field. This way you can identify which documents refer to the same replication \-
you can for example define a view which maps replication IDs to document IDs.
.SS Canceling replications
.sp
To cancel a replication simply \fBDELETE\fP the document which triggered the
replication. The Couch log will show you an entry like the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[Thu, 17 Feb 2011 20:16:29 GMT] [info] [<0.125.0>] Stopped replication \(gac0ebe9256695ff083347cbf95f93e280+continuous+create_target\(ga because replication document \(gadoc_A\(ga was deleted
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You need to \fBDELETE\fP the document that triggered the replication.
\fBDELETE\fP\-ing another document that describes the same replication
but did not trigger it, will not cancel the replication.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Server restart
.sp
When CouchDB is restarted, it checks its \fB_replicator\fP database and
restarts any replication that is described by a document that either has
its \fB_replication_state\fP field set to \fBtriggered\fP or it doesn\(aqt have
yet the \fB_replication_state\fP field set.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Continuous replications always have a \fB_replication_state\fP field
with the value \fBtriggered\fP, therefore they\(aqre always restarted
when CouchDB is restarted.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Updating Documents in the Replicator Database
.sp
Once the replicator has started work on a job defined in the \fB_replicator\fP
database, modifying the replication document is no longer allowed. Attempting
to do this will result in the following response
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

    "error": "forbidden",
    "reason": "Only the replicator can edit replication documents that are in the triggered state."

.UNINDENT
.sp
The way to accomplish this is to first delete the old version and then insert
the new one.
.SS Additional Replicator Databases
.sp
Imagine replicator database (\fB_replicator\fP) has these two
documents which represent pull replications from servers A and B:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

Now without stopping and restarting CouchDB, add another replicator database.
For example \fBanother/_replicator\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ curl \-X PUT http://user:pass@localhost:5984/another%2F_replicator/

\fBNOTE:\fP

Then add a replication document to the new replicator database:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

    "source":  "http://xserver.com:5984/foo",
    "target":  "http://user:pass@localhost:5984/foo_x",
    "continuous":  true
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
From now on, there are three replications active in the system: two replications
from A and B, and a new one from X.
.sp
Then remove the additional replicator database:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ curl \-X DELETE http://user:pass@localhost:5984/another%2F_replicator/
{"ok":true}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After this operation, replication pulling from server X
will be stopped and the replications in the \fB_replicator\fP
database (pulling from servers A and B) will continue.
.SS Replicating the replicator database
.sp
Imagine you have in server C a replicator database with the two
following pull replication documents in it:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
     "_id": "rep_from_A",

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

Now you would like to have the same pull replications going on in server
D, that is, you would like to have server D pull replicating from
servers A and B. You have two options:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Explicitly add two documents to server\(aqs D replicator database
.IP \(bu 2
Replicate server\(aqs C replicator database into server\(aqs D replicator
database
.UNINDENT
.sp
Both alternatives accomplish exactly the same goal.
.SS Delegations
.sp
Replication documents can have a custom \fBuser_ctx\fP property. This
property defines the user context under which a replication runs. For
the old way of triggering a replication (POSTing to \fB/_replicate/\fP),
this property is not needed. That\(aqs because information about the
authenticated user is readily available during the replication, which is
not persistent in that case. Now, with the replicator database, the
problem is that information about which user is starting a particular
replication is only present when the replication document is written.
The information in the replication document and the replication itself
are persistent, however. This implementation detail implies that in the
case of a non\-admin user, a \fBuser_ctx\fP property containing the user\(aqs
name and a subset of their roles must be defined in the replication
document. This is enforced by the document update validation function
present in the default design document of the replicator database. The
validation function also ensures that non\-admin users are unable to set
the value of the user context\(aqs \fBname\fP property to anything other than
their own user name. The same principle applies for roles.
.sp
For admins, the \fBuser_ctx\fP property is optional, and if it\(aqs missing
it defaults to a user context with name \fBnull\fP and an empty list of
roles, which means design documents won\(aqt be written to local targets.
If writing design documents to local targets is desired, the role
\fB_admin\fP must be present in the user context\(aqs list of roles.
.sp
Also, for admins the \fBuser_ctx\fP property can be used to trigger a
replication on behalf of another user. This is the user context that
will be passed to local target database document validation functions.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fBuser_ctx\fP property only has effect for local endpoints.

        "roles": ["erlanger", "researcher"]
    }

As stated before, the \fBuser_ctx\fP property is optional for admins, while
being mandatory for regular (non\-admin) users. When the roles property
of \fBuser_ctx\fP is missing, it defaults to the empty list \fB[]\fP\&.
.SS Replication and conflict model
.sp
Let\(aqs take the following example to illustrate replication and conflict
handling.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Alice has a document containing Bob\(aqs business card;
.IP \(bu 2
She synchronizes it between her desktop PC and her laptop;
.IP \(bu 2
On the desktop PC, she updates Bob\(aqs E\-mail address;
Without syncing again, she updates Bob\(aqs mobile number on the laptop;
.IP \(bu 2
Then she replicates the two to each other again.
.UNINDENT
.sp
So on the desktop the document has Bob\(aqs new E\-mail address and his old mobile
number, and on the laptop it has his old E\-mail address and his new mobile
number.
.sp
The question is, what happens to these conflicting updated documents?
.SS CouchDB replication
.sp
CouchDB works with JSON documents inside databases. Replication of databases
takes place over HTTP, and can be either a "pull" or a "push", but is
unidirectional. So the easiest way to perform a full sync is to do a "push"
followed by a "pull" (or vice versa).
.sp
So, Alice creates v1 and sync it. She updates to v2a on one side and v2b on the
other, and then replicates. What happens?
.sp
The answer is simple: both versions exist on both sides!

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After all, this is not a filesystem, so there\(aqs no restriction that only one
document can exist with the name /db/bob. These are just "conflicting" revisions
under the same name.
.sp
Because the changes are always replicated, the data is safe. Both machines have
identical copies of both documents, so failure of a hard drive on either side
won\(aqt lose any of the changes.
.sp
Another thing to notice is that peers do not have to be configured or tracked.
You can do regular replications to peers, or you can do one\-off, ad\-hoc pushes
or pulls. After the replication has taken place, there is no record kept of
which peer any particular document or revision came from.
.sp
So the question now is: what happens when you try to read /db/bob? By default,
CouchDB picks one arbitrary revision as the "winner", using a deterministic
algorithm so that the same choice will be made on all peers. The same happens
with views: the deterministically\-chosen winner is the only revision fed into
your map function.
.sp
Let\(aqs say that the winner is v2a. On the desktop, if Alice reads the document
she\(aqll see v2a, which is what she saved there. But on the laptop, after
replication, she\(aqll also see only v2a. It could look as if the changes she made
there have been lost \- but of course they have not, they have just been hidden
away as a conflicting revision. But eventually she\(aqll need these changes merged
into Bob\(aqs business card, otherwise they will effectively have been lost.
.sp
Any sensible business\-card application will, at minimum, have to present the
conflicting versions to Alice and allow her to create a new version
incorporating information from them all. Ideally it would merge the updates
itself.
.SS Conflict avoidance
.sp
When working on a single node, CouchDB will avoid creating conflicting revisions
by returning a \fI\%409 Conflict\fP error. This is because, when you
PUT a new version of a document, you must give the \fB_rev\fP of the previous
version. If that \fB_rev\fP has already been superseded, the update is rejected
with a  \fI\%409 Conflict\fP response.
.sp
So imagine two users on the same node are fetching Bob\(aqs business card, updating
it concurrently, and writing it back:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
USER1    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\->  GET /db/bob
         <\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  {"_rev":"1\-aaa", ...}

USER2    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\->  GET /db/bob
         <\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  {"_rev":"1\-aaa", ...}

USER1    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\->  PUT /db/bob?rev=1\-aaa
         <\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  {"_rev":"2\-bbb", ...}

USER2    \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\->  PUT /db/bob?rev=1\-aaa
         <\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  409 Conflict  (not saved)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
User2\(aqs changes are rejected, so it\(aqs up to the app to fetch /db/bob again,
and either:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
apply the same changes as were applied to the earlier revision, and submit
a new PUT
.IP 2. 3
redisplay the document so the user has to edit it again
.IP 3. 3
just overwrite it with the document being saved before (which is not
advisable, as user1\(aqs changes will be silently lost)
.UNINDENT
.sp
So when working in this mode, your application still has to be able to handle
these conflicts and have a suitable retry strategy, but these conflicts never
end up inside the database itself.
.SS Revision tree
.sp
When you update a document in CouchDB, it keeps a list of the previous
revisions. In the case where conflicting updates are introduced, this history
branches into a tree, where the current conflicting revisions for this document
form the tips (leaf nodes) of this tree:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
  ,\-\-> r2a
r1 \-\-> r2b
  \(ga\-\-> r2c
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each branch can then extend its history \- for example if you read revision r2b
and then PUT with ?rev=r2b then you will make a new revision along that
particular branch.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
  ,\-\-> r2a \-> r3a \-> r4a
r1 \-\-> r2b \-> r3b
  \(ga\-\-> r2c \-> r3c
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Here, (r4a, r3b, r3c) are the set of conflicting revisions. The way you resolve
a conflict is to delete the leaf nodes along the other branches. So when you
combine (r4a+r3b+r3c) into a single merged document, you would replace r4a and
delete r3b and r3c.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
  ,\-\-> r2a \-> r3a \-> r4a \-> r5a
r1 \-\-> r2b \-> r3b \-> (r4b deleted)
  \(ga\-\-> r2c \-> r3c \-> (r4c deleted)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that r4b and r4c still exist as leaf nodes in the history tree, but as
deleted docs. You can retrieve them but they will be marked \fB"_deleted":true\fP\&.
.sp
When you compact a database, the bodies of all the non\-leaf documents are
discarded. However, the list of historical _revs is retained, for the benefit of
later conflict resolution in case you meet any old replicas of the database at
some time in future. There is "revision pruning" to stop this getting
arbitrarily large.
.SS Working with conflicting documents
.sp
The basic \fI:get:\(ga/{doc}/{docid}\(ga\fP operation will not show you any
information about conflicts. You see only the deterministically\-chosen winner,
and get no indication as to whether other conflicting revisions exist or not:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id":"test",
    "_rev":"2\-b91bb807b4685080c6a651115ff558f5",
    "hello":"bar"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you do \fBGET /db/test?conflicts=true\fP, and the document is in a conflict
state, then you will get the winner plus a _conflicts member containing an array
of the revs of the other, conflicting revision(s). You can then fetch them
individually using subsequent \fBGET /db/test?rev=xxxx\fP operations:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id":"test",
    "_rev":"2\-b91bb807b4685080c6a651115ff558f5",
    "hello":"bar",
    "_conflicts":[
        "2\-65db2a11b5172bf928e3bcf59f728970",
        "2\-5bc3c6319edf62d4c624277fdd0ae191"
    ]
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you do \fBGET /db/test?open_revs=all\fP then you will get all the leaf nodes of
the revision tree. This will give you all the current conflicts, but will also
give you leaf nodes which have been deleted (i.e. parts of the conflict history
which have since been resolved). You can remove these by filtering out documents
with \fB"_deleted":true\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[
    {"ok":{"_id":"test","_rev":"2\-5bc3c6319edf62d4c624277fdd0ae191","hello":"foo"}},
    {"ok":{"_id":"test","_rev":"2\-65db2a11b5172bf928e3bcf59f728970","hello":"baz"}},
    {"ok":{"_id":"test","_rev":"2\-b91bb807b4685080c6a651115ff558f5","hello":"bar"}}
]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB"ok"\fP tag is an artifact of \fBopen_revs\fP, which also lets you list
explicit revisions as a JSON array, e.g. \fBopen_revs=[rev1,rev2,rev3]\fP\&. In this
form, it would be possible to request a revision which is now missing, because
the database has been compacted.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The order of revisions returned by \fBopen_revs=all\fP is \fBNOT\fP related to
the deterministic "winning" algorithm. In the above example, the winning
revision is 2\-b91b... and happens to be returned last, but in other cases it
can be returned in a different position.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once you have retrieved all the conflicting revisions, your application can then
choose to display them all to the user. Or it could attempt to merge them, write
back the merged version, and delete the conflicting versions \- that is, to
resolve the conflict permanently.
.sp
As described above, you need to update one revision and delete all the
conflicting revisions explicitly. This can be done using a single \fIPOST\fP to
\fB_bulk_docs\fP, setting \fB"_deleted":true\fP on those revisions you wish to
delete.
.SS Multiple document API
.sp
You can fetch multiple documents at once using \fBinclude_docs=true\fP on a view.

Views only get the winning revision of a document. However they do also get a

If you do this, you can have a separate "sweep" process which periodically scans
your database, looks for documents which have conflicts, fetches the conflicting
revisions, and resolves them.
.sp
Whilst this keeps the main application simple, the problem with this approach is
that there will be a window between a conflict being introduced and it being
resolved. From a user\(aqs viewpoint, this may appear that the document they just
saved successfully may suddenly lose their changes, only to be resurrected some
time later. This may or may not be acceptable.
.sp
Also, it\(aqs easy to forget to start the sweeper, or not to implement it properly,
and this will introduce odd behaviour which will be hard to track down.
.sp
CouchDB\(aqs "winning" revision algorithm may mean that information drops out of a
view until a conflict has been resolved. Consider Bob\(aqs business card again;
suppose Alice has a view which emits mobile numbers, so that her telephony
application can display the caller\(aqs name based on caller ID. If there are
conflicting documents with Bob\(aqs old and new mobile numbers, and they happen to
be resolved in favour of Bob\(aqs old number, then the view won\(aqt be able to
recognise his new one. In this particular case, the application might have
preferred to put information from both the conflicting documents into the view,
but this currently isn\(aqt possible.
.sp
Suggested algorithm to fetch a document with conflict resolution:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Get document via \fBGET docid?conflicts=true\fP request;
.IP 2. 3
For each member in the \fB_conflicts\fP array call \fBGET docid?rev=xxx\fP\&.
If any errors occur at this stage, restart from step 1.
(There could be a race where someone else has already resolved this conflict
and deleted that rev)
.IP 3. 3
Perform application\-specific merging
.IP 4. 3
Write \fB_bulk_docs\fP with an update to the first rev and deletes of the other
revs.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This could either be done on every read (in which case you could replace all
calls to GET in your application with calls to a library which does the above),
or as part of your sweeper code.
.sp

An application written this way never has to deal with a \fBPUT 409\fP, and is
automatically multi\-master capable.
.sp
You can see that it\(aqs straightforward enough when you know what you\(aqre doing.
It\(aqs just that CouchDB doesn\(aqt currently provide a convenient HTTP API for
"fetch all conflicting revisions", nor "PUT to supersede these N revisions", so
you need to wrap these yourself. I also don\(aqt know of any client\-side libraries
which provide support for this.
.SS Merging and revision history
.sp
Actually performing the merge is an application\-specific function. It depends
on the structure of your data. Sometimes it will be easy: e.g. if a document
contains a list which is only ever appended to, then you can perform a union of
the two list versions.
.sp
Some merge strategies look at the changes made to an object, compared to its
previous version. This is how git\(aqs merge function works.
.sp
For example, to merge Bob\(aqs business card versions v2a and v2b, you could look
at the differences between v1 and v2b, and then apply these changes to v2a as
well.
.sp
With CouchDB, you can sometimes get hold of old revisions of a document.
For example, if you fetch \fB/db/bob?rev=v2b&revs_info=true\fP you\(aqll get a list
of the previous revision ids which ended up with revision v2b. Doing the same
for v2a you can find their common ancestor revision. However if the database
has been compacted, the content of that document revision will have been lost.
\fBrevs_info\fP will still show that v1 was an ancestor, but report it as
"missing":
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
BEFORE COMPACTION           AFTER COMPACTION

     ,\-> v2a                     v2a

     \(ga\-> v2b                     v2b
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
So if you want to work with diffs, the recommended way is to store those diffs
within the new revision itself. That is: when you replace v1 with v2a, include
an extra field or attachment in v2a which says which fields were changed from
v1 to v2a. This unfortunately does mean additional book\-keeping for your
application.
.SS Comparison with other replicating data stores
.sp
The same issues arise with other replicating systems, so it can be instructive
to look at these and see how they compare with CouchDB. Please feel free to add
other examples.
.SS Unison
.sp
\fI\%Unison\fP is a bi\-directional file synchronisation tool. In this case, the
business card would be a file, say \fIbob.vcf\fP\&.
.sp
When you run unison, changes propagate both ways. If a file has changed on one
side but not the other, the new replaces the old. Unison maintains a local state
file so that it knows whether a file has changed since the last successful
replication.
.sp
In our example it has changed on both sides. Only one file called \fIbob.vcf\fP
can exist within the filesystem. Unison solves the problem by simply ducking
out: the user can choose to replace the remote version with the local version,
or vice versa (both of which would lose data), but the default action is to
leave both sides unchanged.
.sp
From Alice\(aqs point of view, at least this is a simple solution. Whenever she\(aqs
on the desktop she\(aqll see the version she last edited on the desktop, and
whenever she\(aqs on the laptop she\(aqll see the version she last edited there.
.sp
But because no replication has actually taken place, the data is not protected.
If her laptop hard drive dies, she\(aqll lose all her changes made on the laptop;
ditto if her desktop hard drive dies.
.sp
It\(aqs up to her to copy across one of the versions manually (under a different
filename), merge the two, and then finally push the merged version to the other
side.
.sp
Note also that the original file (version v1) has been lost by this point.
So it\(aqs not going to be known from inspection alone which of v2a and v2b has the
most up\-to\-date E\-mail address for Bob, and which has the most up\-to\-date mobile
number. Alice has to remember which she entered last.
.SS Git
.sp
\fI\%Git\fP is a well\-known distributed source control system. Like Unison, git deals
with files. However, git considers the state of a whole set of files as a single
object, the "tree". Whenever you save an update, you create a "commit" which
points to both the updated tree and the previous commit(s), which in turn point
to the previous tree(s). You therefore have a full history of all the states of
the files. This forms a branch, and a pointer is kept to the tip of the branch,
from which you can work backwards to any previous state. The "pointer" is
actually an SHA1 hash of the tip commit.
.sp
If you are replicating with one or more peers, a separate branch is made for
each of the peers. For example, you might have:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
master               \-\- my local branch
remotes/foo/master   \-\- branch on peer \(aqfoo\(aq
remotes/bar/master   \-\- branch on peer \(aqbar\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the normal way of working, replication is a "pull", importing changes from
a remote peer into the local repository. A "pull" does two things: first "fetch"
the state of the peer into the remote tracking branch for that peer; and then
attempt to "merge" those changes into the local branch.
.sp
Now let\(aqs consider the business card. Alice has created a git repo containing
\fBbob.vcf\fP, and cloned it across to the other machine. The branches look like
this, where \fBAAAAAAAA\fP is the SHA1 of the commit:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- desktop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-           \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- laptop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
master: AAAAAAAA                        master: AAAAAAAA
remotes/laptop/master: AAAAAAAA         remotes/desktop/master: AAAAAAAA
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now she makes a change on the desktop, and commits it into the desktop repo;
then she makes a different change on the laptop, and commits it into the laptop
repo:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- desktop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-           \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- laptop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

remotes/laptop/master: AAAAAAAA         remotes/desktop/master: AAAAAAAA
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now on the desktop she does \fBgit pull laptop\fP\&. Firstly, the remote objects
are copied across into the local repo and the remote tracking branch is
updated:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- desktop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-           \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- laptop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
master: BBBBBBBB                        master: CCCCCCCC
remotes/laptop/master: CCCCCCCC         remotes/desktop/master: AAAAAAAA
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
repo still contains AAAAAAAA because commits BBBBBBBB and CCCCCCCC point to
it
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then git will attempt to merge the changes in. It can do this because it knows
the parent commit to \fBCCCCCCCC\fP is \fBAAAAAAAA\fP, so it takes a diff between
\fBAAAAAAAA\fP and \fBCCCCCCCC\fP and tries to apply it to \fBBBBBBBBB\fP\&.
.sp
If this is successful, then you\(aqll get a new version with a merge commit:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- desktop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-           \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- laptop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

remotes/laptop/master: CCCCCCCC         remotes/desktop/master: AAAAAAAA
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then Alice has to logon to the laptop and run \fBgit pull desktop\fP\&. A similar
process occurs. The remote tracking branch is updated:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- desktop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-           \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- laptop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
master: DDDDDDDD                        master: CCCCCCCC
remotes/laptop/master: CCCCCCCC         remotes/desktop/master: DDDDDDDD
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then a merge takes place. This is a special\-case: \fBCCCCCCCC\fP one of the parent
commits of \fBDDDDDDDD\fP, so the laptop can \fIfast forward\fP update from
\fBCCCCCCCC\fP to \fBDDDDDDDD\fP directly without having to do any complex merging.
This leaves the final state as:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- desktop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-           \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- laptop \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

remotes/laptop/master: CCCCCCCC         remotes/desktop/master: DDDDDDDD
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now this is all and good, but you may wonder how this is relevant when thinking
about CouchDB.
.sp
Firstly, note what happens in the case when the merge algorithm fails.
The changes are still propagated from the remote repo into the local one, and
are available in the remote tracking branch; so unlike Unison, you know the data
is protected. It\(aqs just that the local working copy may fail to update, or may
diverge from the remote version. It\(aqs up to you to create and commit the
combined version yourself, but you are guaranteed to have all the history you
might need to do this.
.sp
Note that whilst it\(aqs possible to build new merge algorithms into Git,
the standard ones are focused on line\-based changes to source code. They don\(aqt
work well for XML or JSON if it\(aqs presented without any line breaks.
.sp
The other interesting consideration is multiple peers. In this case you have
multiple remote tracking branches, some of which may match your local branch,
some of which may be behind you, and some of which may be ahead of you
(i.e. contain changes that you haven\(aqt yet merged):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
master: AAAAAAAA
remotes/foo/master: BBBBBBBB
remotes/bar/master: CCCCCCCC
remotes/baz/master: AAAAAAAA
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that each peer is explicitly tracked, and therefore has to be explicitly
created. If a peer becomes stale or is no longer needed, it\(aqs up to you to
remove it from your configuration and delete the remote tracking branch.
This is different to CouchDB, which doesn\(aqt keep any peer state in the database.
.sp
Another difference with git is that it maintains all history back to time
zero \- git compaction keeps diffs between all those versions in order to reduce
size, but CouchDB discards them. If you are constantly updating a document,
the size of a git repo would grow forever. It is possible (with some effort)
to use "history rewriting" to make git forget commits earlier than a particular
one.

.sp
\fBIf you know Git, then you know how Couch replication works.\fP Replicating is
\fIvery\fP similar to pushing or pulling with distributed source managers like Git.
.sp
\fBCouchDB replication does not have its own protocol.\fP A replicator simply
connects to two DBs as a client, then reads from one and writes to the other.
Push replication is reading the local data and updating the remote DB;
pull replication is vice versa.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFun fact 1\fP: The replicator is actually an independent Erlang application,
in its own process. It connects to both couches, then reads records from one
and writes them to the other.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFun fact 2\fP: CouchDB has no way of knowing who is a normal client and who
is a replicator (let alone whether the replication is push or pull).
It all looks like client connections. Some of them read records. Some of them
write records.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBEverything flows from the data model\fP
.sp
The replication algorithm is trivial, uninteresting. A trained monkey could
design it. It\(aqs simple because the cleverness is the data model, which has these
useful characteristics:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Every record in CouchDB is completely independent of all others. That sucks
if you want to do a JOIN or a transaction, but it\(aqs awesome if you want to
write a replicator. Just figure out how to replicate one record, and then
repeat that for each record.
.IP 2. 3
Like Git, records have a linked\-list revision history. A record\(aqs revision ID
is the checksum of its own data. Subsequent revision IDs are checksums of:
the new data, plus the revision ID of the previous.
.IP 3. 3
In addition to application data (\fB{"name": "Jason", "awesome": true}\fP),
every record stores the evolutionary timeline of all previous revision IDs
leading up to itself.
.INDENT 3.0
.IP \(bu 2
Exercise: Take a moment of quiet reflection. Consider any two different
records, A and B. If A\(aqs revision ID appears in B\(aqs timeline, then B
definitely evolved from A. Now consider Git\(aqs fast\-forward merges.
Do you hear that? That is the sound of your mind being blown.
.UNINDENT
.IP 4. 3
Git isn\(aqt really a linear list. It has forks, when one parent has multiple
children. CouchDB has that too.
.INDENT 3.0
.IP \(bu 2
Exercise: Compare two different records, A and B. A\(aqs revision ID does not
appear in B\(aqs timeline; however, one revision ID, C, is in both A\(aqs and B\(aqs
timeline. Thus A didn\(aqt evolve from B. B didn\(aqt evolve from A. But rather,
A and B have a common ancestor C. In Git, that is a "fork." In CouchDB,
it\(aqs a "conflict."
.IP \(bu 2
In Git, if both children go on to develop their timelines independently,
that\(aqs cool. Forks totally support that.
.IP \(bu 2
In CouchDB, if both children go on to develop their timelines
independently, that cool too. Conflicts totally support that.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFun fact 3\fP: CouchDB "conflicts" do not correspond to Git "conflicts."
A Couch conflict is a divergent revision history, what Git calls a "fork."
For this reason the CouchDB community pronounces "conflict" with a silent
\fIn\fP: "co\-flicked."
.UNINDENT
.IP 5. 3
Git also has merges, when one child has multiple parents. CouchDB \fIsort\fP of
has that too.
.INDENT 3.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBIn the data model, there is no merge.\fP The client simply marks one
timeline as deleted and continues to work with the only extant timeline.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBIn the application, it feels like a merge.\fP Typically, the client merges
the \fIdata\fP from each timeline in an application\-specific way.
Then it writes the new data to the timeline. In Git, this is like copying
and pasting the changes from branch A into branch B, then commiting to
branch B and deleting branch A. The data was merged, but there was no
\fIgit merge\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
These behaviors are different because, in Git, the timeline itself is
important; but in CouchDB, the data is important and the timeline is
incidental—it\(aqs just there to support replication. That is one reason why
CouchDB\(aqs built\-in revisioning is inappropriate for storing revision data
like a wiki page.

\fBFinal notes\fP
.sp
At least one sentence in this writeup (possibly this one) is complete BS.
.SH COUCHDB MAINTENANCE
.SS Compaction
.sp
The \fIcompaction\fP operation is the way to reduce disk space usage by removing
unused and old data from database or view index files. This operation is a very
similar to the \fIvacuum\fP (\fI\%SQLite\fP ex.) available for other database management
systems.
.sp
During compaction of the \fItarget\fP CouchDB creates new file with the \fB\&.compact\fP
extension and transfers only actual data into. Because of this, CouchDB checks
first for the available disk space \- it should be \fItwice greater\fP than the
compacted file\(aqs data.
.sp
When all actual data is successfully transferred to the \fIcompacted\fP file CouchDB
replaces the \fItarget\fP with the \fIcompacted\fP file.
.SS Database Compaction
.sp
Database compaction compresses the database file by removing unused file
sections created during updates. Old documents revisions are replaced with
small amount of metadata called \fItombstone\fP which are used for conflicts
resolution during replication. The number of stored revisions
(and their \fItombstones\fP) can be configured by using the \fB_revs_limit\fP URL endpoint.
.sp
Compaction is manually triggered operation per database and runs as a background
task. To start it for specific database there is need to send HTTP

.SS Views cleanup
.sp
View indexes on disk are named after their \fIMD5\fP hash of the view definition.
When you change a view, old indexes remain on disk. To clean up all outdated
view indexes (files named after the MD5 representation of views, that does not
exist anymore) you can trigger a \fIview cleanup\fP:

.SS Automatic Compaction
.sp
While both \fIdatabase\fP and \fIviews\fP
compactions are required be manually triggered, it is also possible to configure
automatic compaction, so that compaction of databases and views is automatically
triggered based on various criteria. Automatic compaction is configured in
CouchDB\(aqs \fIconfiguration files\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBdaemons/compaction_daemon\fP is responsible for triggering
the compaction. It is automatically started, but disabled by default.
The criteria for triggering the compactions is configured in the
\fBcompactions\fP section.
.SS Performance
.sp
With up to tens of thousands of documents you will generally find CouchDB to
perform well no matter how you write your code. Once you start getting into
the millions of documents you need to be a lot more careful.
.SS Disk I/O
.SS File Size
.sp
The smaller your file size, the less \fII/O\fP operations there will be,
the more of the file can be cached by CouchDB and the operating system,
the quicker it is to replicate, backup etc. Consequently you should carefully
examine the data you are storing. For example it would be silly to use keys
that are hundreds of characters long, but your program would be hard to
maintain if you only used single character keys. Carefully consider data
that is duplicated by putting it in views.
.SS Disk and File System Performance
.sp
Using faster disks, striped RAID arrays and modern file systems can all speed
up your CouchDB deployment. However, there is one option that can increase
the responsiveness of your CouchDB server when disk performance is a
bottleneck. From the Erlang documentation for the file module:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
On operating systems with thread support, it is possible to let file
operations be performed in threads of their own, allowing other Erlang
processes to continue executing in parallel with the file operations.
See the \fI\%command line flag +A in erl(1)\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Setting this argument to a number greater than zero can keep your CouchDB
installation responsive even during periods of heavy disk utilization. The
easiest way to set this option is through the \fBERL_FLAGS\fP environment
variable. For example, to give Erlang four threads with which to perform I/O
operations add the following to \fB(prefix)/etc/defaults/couchdb\fP
(or equivalent):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export ERL_FLAGS="+A 4"
.ft P

.UNINDENT

.SS System Resource Limits
.sp
One of the problems that administrators run into as their deployments become
large are resource limits imposed by the system and by the application
configuration. Raising these limits can allow your deployment to grow beyond
what the default configuration will support.
.SS CouchDB Configuration Options
.SS delayed_commits
.sp
The \fBdelayed commits\fP allows to
achieve better write performance for some workloads while sacrificing a small
amount of durability. The setting causes CouchDB to wait up to a full second
before committing new data after an update. If the server crashes before
the header is written then any writes since the last commit are lost. Keep this
option enabled on your own risk.
.SS max_dbs_open
.sp
In your \fIconfiguration\fP (local.ini or similar) familiarize
yourself with the \fBcouchdb/max_dbs_open\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[couchdb]
max_dbs_open = 100
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This option places an upper bound on the number of databases that can be
open at one time. CouchDB reference counts database accesses internally and
will close idle databases when it must. Sometimes it is necessary to keep
more than the default open at once, such as in deployments where many databases
will be continuously replicating.
.SS Erlang
.sp
Even if you\(aqve increased the maximum connections CouchDB will allow,
the Erlang runtime system will not allow more than 1024 connections by
default. Adding the following directive to \fB(prefix)/etc/default/couchdb\fP (or
equivalent) will increase this limit (in this case to 4096):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
export ERL_MAX_PORTS=4096
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CouchDB versions up to 1.1.x also create Erlang Term Storage (\fI\%ETS\fP) tables for
each replication. If you are using a version of CouchDB older than 1.2 and
must support many replications, also set the \fBERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES\fP variable.
The default is approximately 1400 tables.
.sp
Note that on Mac OS X, Erlang will not actually increase the file descriptor
limit past 1024 (i.e. the system header–defined value of \fBFD_SETSIZE\fP). See
\fI\%this tip for a possible workaround\fP and \fI\%this thread for a deeper
explanation\fP\&.
.SS PAM and ulimit
.sp
Finally, most *nix operating systems impose various resource limits on every
process. If your system is set up to use the Pluggable Authentication Modules
(\fI\%PAM\fP) system, increasing this limit is straightforward. For example,
creating a file named \fB/etc/security/limits.d/100\-couchdb.conf\fP with the
following contents will ensure that CouchDB can open enough file descriptors
to service your increased maximum open databases and Erlang ports:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#<domain>    <type>    <item>    <value>
couchdb      hard      nofile    4096
couchdb      soft      nofile    4096
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If your system does not use PAM, a \fIulimit\fP command is usually available for
use in a custom script to launch CouchDB with increased resource limits.
If necessary, feel free to increase this limits as long as your hardware can
handle the load.
.SS Network
.sp
There is latency overhead making and receiving each request/response.
In general you should do your requests in batches. Most APIs have some
mechanism to do batches, usually by supplying lists of documents or keys in
the request body. Be careful what size you pick for the batches. The larger
batch requires more time your client has to spend encoding the items into JSON
and more time is spent decoding that number of responses. Do some benchmarking
with your own configuration and typical data to find the sweet spot.
It is likely to be between one and ten thousand documents.
.sp
If you have a fast I/O system then you can also use concurrency \- have
multiple requests/responses at the same time. This mitigates the latency
involved in assembling JSON, doing the networking and decoding JSON.
.sp
As of CouchDB 1.1.0, users often report lower write performance of documents
compared to older releases. The main reason is that this release ships with
the more recent version of the HTTP server library Mochiweb, which by default
sets the TCP socket option \fI\%SO_NODELAY\fP to false. This means that small data
sent to the TCP socket, like the reply to a document write request (or reading
a very small document), will not be sent immediately to the network \- TCP will
buffer it for a while hoping that it will be asked to send more data through
the same socket and then send all the data at once for increased performance.
This TCP buffering behaviour can be disabled via
\fBhttpd/socket_options\fP:

.SS DELETE operation
.sp
When you \fI\%DELETE\fP a document the database will create a new
revision which contains the \fB_id\fP and \fB_rev\fP fields as well as
the \fI_deleted\fP flag. This revision will remain even after a \fIdatabase
compaction\fP so that the deletion can be replicated. Deleted documents, like
non\-deleted documents, can affect view build times, \fI\%PUT\fP and
\fI\%DELETE\fP requests time and size of database on disk, since they
increase the size of the B+Tree\(aqs. You can see the number of deleted documents
in \fBdatabase information\fP\&. If your use case creates lots of
deleted documents (for example, if you are storing short\-term data like logfile
entries, message queues, etc), you might want to periodically switch to a new
database and delete the old one (once the entries in it have all expired).
.SS Document\(aqs ID
.sp
The db file size is derived from your document and view sizes but also on a
multiple of your \fB_id\fP sizes. Not only is the \fB_id\fP present in the document,
but it and parts of it are duplicated in the binary tree structure CouchDB uses
to navigate the file to find the document in the first place. As a real world
example for one user switching from 16 byte ids to 4 byte ids made a database
go from 21GB to 4GB with 10 million documents (the raw JSON text when from
2.5GB to 2GB).
.sp
Inserting with sequential (and at least sorted) ids is faster than random ids.
Consequently you should consider generating ids yourself, allocating them
sequentially and using an encoding scheme that consumes fewer bytes.
For example, something that takes 16 hex digits to represent can be done in
4 base 62 digits (10 numerals, 26 lower case, 26 upper case).
.SS Views
.SS Views Generation
.sp
Views with the JavaScript query server are extremely slow to generate when
there are a non\-trivial number of documents to process. The generation process
won\(aqt even saturate a single CPU let alone your I/O. The cause is the latency
involved in the CouchDB server and separate \fIcouchjs\fP query server, dramatically
indicating how important it is to take latency out of your implementation.
.sp
You can let view access be "stale" but it isn\(aqt practical to determine when
that will occur giving you a quick response and when views will be updated
which will take a long time. (A 10 million document database took about 10
minutes to load into CouchDB but about 4 hours to do view generation).
.sp
View information isn\(aqt replicated \- it is rebuilt on each database so you
can\(aqt do the view generation on a separate sever.
.SS Builtin Reduce Functions
.sp
If you’re using a very simple view function that only performs a sum or count
reduction, you can call native Erlang implementations of them by simply
writing \fB_sum\fP or \fB_count\fP in place of your function declaration.
This will speed up things dramatically, as it cuts down on IO between CouchDB
and the \fIJavaScript query server\fP\&. For example, as
\fI\%mentioned on the mailing list\fP, the time for outputting an (already indexed
and cached) view with about 78,000 items went down from 60 seconds to 4 seconds.

In this example a key/value pair is emitted for each value in the \fItags\fP array

different keys.
.sp
Also keep in mind that each document is \fIsealed\fP to prevent the situation where
one map function changes document state and another receives a modified version.
.sp
For efficiency reasons, documents are passed to a group of map functions \- each
document is processed by a group of map functions from all views of the related
design document. This means that if you trigger an index update for one view in
the design document, all others will get updated too.

(first argument is \fBnull\fP).
.sp
Note that if the result of a \fIreduce\fP function is longer than the initial

While disabling \fBreduce_limit\fP might be useful for debug proposes, remember

single value \- which could be an array or similar object.
.SS Builtin Reduce Functions

\fBWhy don\(aqt reduce functions support CommonJS modules?\fP
.sp
While \fImap\fP functions have limited access to stored modules through
\fBrequire()\fP, there is no such feature for \fIreduce\fP functions.
The reason lies deep inside the way \fImap\fP and \fIreduce\fP
functions are processed by the Query Server. Let\(aqs take a look at \fImap\fP
functions first:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
CouchDB sends all \fImap\fP functions in a processed design document to the
Query Server.
.IP 2. 3
the Query Server handles them one by one, compiles and puts them onto an
internal stack.
.IP 3. 3
after all \fImap\fP functions have been processed, CouchDB will send the
remaining documents for indexing, one by one.
.IP 4. 3
the Query Server receives the document object and applies it to every
function from the stack. The emitted results are then joined into a
single array and sent back to CouchDB.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now let\(aqs see how \fIreduce\fP functions are handled:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
CouchDB sends \fIas a single command\fP the list of available \fIreduce\fP
functions with the result list of key\-value pairs that were previously
returned from the \fImap\fP functions.
.IP 2. 3
the Query Server compiles the reduce functions and applies them to the
key\-value lists. The reduced result is sent back to CouchDB.
.UNINDENT
.sp
As you may note, \fIreduce\fP functions are applied in a single shot to the map
results while \fImap\fP functions are applied to documents one by one. This
means that it\(aqs possible for \fImap\fP functions to precompile CommonJS
libraries and use them during the entire view processing, but for \fIreduce\fP
functions they would be compiled again and again for each view result
reduction, which would lead to performance degradation.

Show functions are used to represent documents in various formats, commonly as
HTML pages with nice formatting. They can also be used to run server\-side
functions without requiring a pre\-existing document.
.sp
Basic example of show function could be:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc, req){
    if (doc) {
        return "Hello from " + doc._id + "!";
    } else {
        return "Hello, world!";
    }
}
.ft P
.fi

Also, there is more simple way to return json encoded data:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc, req){
    return {
        \(aqjson\(aq: {

Update handlers are functions that clients can request to invoke server\-side
logic that will create or update a document. This feature allows a range of use
cases such as providing a server\-side last modified timestamp, updating
individual fields in a document without first getting the latest revision, etc.
.sp
When the request to an update handler includes a document ID in the URL, the
server will provide the function with the most recent version of that document.
You can provide any other values needed by the update handler function via the
\fBPOST\fP/\fBPUT\fP entity body or query string parameters of the request.

Filter functions mostly act like \fIshowfun\fP and \fIlistfun\fP: they
format, or \fIfilter\fP the \fIchanges feed\fP\&.
.SS Classic Filters
.sp
By default the changes feed emits all database documents changes. But if you\(aqre
waiting for some special changes, processing all documents is inefficient.
.sp
Filters are special design document functions that allow the changes feed to
emit only specific documents that pass filter rules.
.sp
Let\(aqs assume that our database is a mailbox and we need to handle only new mail
events (documents with the status \fInew\fP). Our filter function would look like
this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc, req){
    // we need only \(gamail\(ga documents
    if (doc.type != \(aqmail\(aq){
        return false;
    }
    // we\(aqre interested only in \(ganew\(ga ones
    if (doc.status != \(aqnew\(aq){
        return false;
    }
    return true; // passed!
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Filter functions must return \fBtrue\fP if a document passed all the rules.  Now,
if you apply this function to the changes feed it will emit only changes about
"new mails":

We probably need to filter the changes feed of our mailbox by more than a single
status value. We\(aqre also interested in statuses like "spam" to update
spam\-filter heuristic rules, "outgoing" to let a mail daemon actually send
mails, and so on. Creating a lot of similar functions that actually do similar
work isn\(aqt good idea \- so we need a dynamic filter.
.sp
You may have noticed that filter functions take a second argument named
\fIrequest\fP\&. This allows the creation of dynamic filters
based on query parameters, \fIuser context\fP and more.
.sp
The dynamic version of our filter looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc, req){
    // we need only \(gamail\(ga documents
    if (doc.type != \(aqmail\(aq){

Combining filters with a \fIcontinuous\fP feed allows creating powerful event\-driven
systems.
.SS View Filters
.sp
View filters are the same as classic filters above, with one small difference:
they use the \fImap\fP instead of the \fIfilter\fP function of a view, to filter the
changes feed. Each time a key\-value pair is emitted from the \fImap\fP function, a
change is returned. This allows avoiding filter functions that mostly do the
same work as views.
.sp
To use them just pass \fIfilter=_view\fP and \fIview=designdoc/viewname\fP as request
parameters to the \fIchanges feed\fP:

A design document may contain a function named \fIvalidate_doc_update\fP
which can be used to prevent invalid or unauthorized document update requests
from being stored.  The function is passed the new document from the update
request, the current document stored in the database, a \fIuserctx_object\fP
containing information about the user writing the document (if present), and
a \fIsecurity_object\fP with lists of database security roles.

Validation functions typically examine the structure of the new document to
ensure that required fields are present and to verify that the requesting user
should be allowed to make changes to the document properties.  For example,
an application may require that a user must be authenticated in order to create
a new document or that specific document fields be present when a document
is updated. The validation function can abort the pending document write
by throwing one of two error objects:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
// user is not authorized to make the change but may re\-authenticate
throw({ unauthorized: \(aqError message here.\(aq });

// change is not allowed
throw({ forbidden: \(aqError message here.\(aq });
.ft P

Document validation is optional, and each design document in the database may
have at most one validation function.  When a write request is received for
a given database, the validation function in each design document in that
database is called in an unspecified order.  If any of the validation functions
throw an error, the write will not succeed.

modified by a user with the \fB_admin\fP role:

Views are the primary tool used for querying and reporting on CouchDB documents.
There you\(aqll learn how they works and how to use them to build effective
applications with CouchDB
.SS Introduction to Views
.sp
Views are useful for many purposes:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Filtering the documents in your database to find those relevant to a
particular process.
.IP \(bu 2
Extracting data from your documents and presenting it in a specific order.
.IP \(bu 2
Building efficient indexes to find documents by any value or structure that
resides in them.
.IP \(bu 2
Use these indexes to represent relationships among documents.
.IP \(bu 2
Finally, with views you can make all sorts of calculations on the data in your
documents. For example, if documents represent your company’s financial
transactions, a view can answer the question of what the spending was in the
last week, month, or year.
.UNINDENT
.SS What Is a View?
.sp
Let’s go through the different use cases. First is extracting data that you
might need for a special purpose in a specific order. For a front page, we want
a list of blog post titles sorted by date. We’ll work with a set of example
documents as we walk through how views work:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id":"biking",
    "_rev":"AE19EBC7654",

    "title":"Biking",
    "body":"My biggest hobby is mountainbiking. The other day...",
    "date":"2009/01/30 18:04:11"

    "title":"Bought a Cat",
    "body":"I went to the the pet store earlier and brought home a little kitty...",

    "date":"2009/01/15 15:52:20"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Three will do for the example. Note that the documents are sorted by "_id",
which is how they are stored in the database. Now we define a view.
Bear with us without an explanation while we show you some code:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if(doc.date && doc.title) {
        emit(doc.date, doc.title);
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is a \fImap function\fP, and it is written in JavaScript. If you are not
familiar with JavaScript but have used C or any other C\-like language such as
Java, PHP, or C#, this should look familiar. It is a simple function definition.
.sp
You provide CouchDB with view functions as strings stored inside the \fBviews\fP
field of a design document. You don’t run it yourself. Instead, when you
\fIquery your view\fP, CouchDB takes the source code and runs it for you on every
document in the database your view was defined in. You \fIquery your view\fP to
retrieve the \fIview result\fP\&.
.sp
All map functions have a single parameter doc. This is a single document in
the database. Our map function checks whether our document has a \fBdate\fP and
a \fBtitle\fP attribute — luckily, all of our documents have them — and then calls
the built\-in \fBemit()\fP function with these two attributes as arguments.
.sp
The \fBemit()\fP function always takes two arguments: the first is \fBkey\fP,
and the second is \fBvalue\fP\&. The \fBemit(key, value)\fP function creates an entry
in our \fIview result\fP\&. One more thing: the \fBemit()\fP function can be called
multiple times in the map function to create multiple entries in the view
results from a single document, but we are not doing that yet.
.sp
CouchDB takes whatever you pass into the emit() function and puts it into a list
(see Table 1, “View results” below). Each row in that list includes the \fIkey\fP
and \fIvalue\fP\&. More importantly, the list is sorted by key (by \fBdoc.date\fP
in our case).  The most important feature of a view result is that it is sorted
by \fIkey\fP\&. We will come back to that over and over again to do neat things. Stay
tuned.
.sp

.sp
When you query your view, CouchDB takes the source code and runs it for you on
every document in the database. If you have a lot of documents, that takes
quite a bit of time and you might wonder if it is not horribly inefficient
to do this. Yes, it would be, but CouchDB is designed to avoid any extra costs:
it only runs through all documents once, when you first query your view.
If a document is changed, the map function is only run once, to recompute
the keys and values for that single document.
.sp
The view result is stored in a B\-tree, just like the structure that is
responsible for holding your documents. View B\-trees are stored in their
own file, so that for high\-performance CouchDB usage, you can keep views on
their own disk. The B\-tree provides very fast lookups of rows by key, as well
as efficient streaming of rows in a key range. In our example, a single view
can answer all questions that involve time: “Give me all the blog posts from
last week” or “last month” or “this year.” Pretty neat.
.sp
When we query our view, we get back a list of all documents sorted by date.
Each row also includes the post title so we can construct links to posts.
Table 1 is just a graphical representation of the view result.
The actual result is JSON\-encoded and contains a little more metadata:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "total_rows": 3,
    "offset": 0,
    "rows": [
        {
            "key": "2009/01/15 15:52:20",
            "id": "hello\-world",
            "value": "Hello World"
        },

        {
            "key": "2009/01/30 18:04:11",
            "id": "biking",
            "value": "Biking"
        },

        {
            "key": "2009/02/17 21:13:39",
            "id": "bought\-a\-cat",
            "value": "Bought a Cat"
        }

    ]
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now, the actual result is not as nicely formatted and doesn’t include any
superfluous whitespace or newlines, but this is better for you (and us!)
to read and understand. Where does that "id" member in the result rows come
from? That wasn’t there before. That’s because we omitted it earlier to avoid
confusion. CouchDB automatically includes the document ID of the document that
created the entry in the view result. We’ll use this as well when constructing
links to the blog post pages.
.SS Efficient Lookups
.sp
Let’s move on to the second use case for views: “building efficient indexes to
find documents by any value or structure that resides in them.” We already
explained the efficient indexing, but we skipped a few details. This is a good
time to finish this discussion as we are looking at map functions that are a
little more complex.
.sp
First, back to the B\-trees! We explained that the B\-tree that backs the
key\-sorted view result is built only once, when you first query a view,
and all subsequent queries will just read the B\-tree instead of executing
the map function for all documents again. What happens, though, when you change
a document, add a new one, or delete one? Easy: CouchDB is smart enough
to find the rows in the view result that were created by a specific document.
It marks them invalid so that they no longer show up in view results.
If the document was deleted, we’re good — the resulting B\-tree reflects the
state of the database. If a document got updated, the new document is run
through the map function and the resulting new lines are inserted into
the B\-tree at the correct spots. New documents are handled in the same way.
The B\-tree is a very efficient data structure for our needs, and the crash\-only
design of CouchDB databases is carried over to the view indexes as well.
.sp
To add one more point to the efficiency discussion: usually multiple documents
are updated between view queries. The mechanism explained in the previous
paragraph gets applied to all changes in the database since the last time
the view was queried in a batch operation, which makes things even faster and
is generally a better use of your resources.
.SS Find One
.sp
On to more complex map functions. We said “find documents by any value or
structure that resides in them.” We already explained how to extract a value
by which to sort a list of views (our date field). The same mechanism is used
for fast lookups. The URI to query to get a view’s result is
\fB/database/_design/designdocname/_view/viewname\fP\&. This gives you a list of all
rows in the view. We have only three documents, so things are small, but with
thousands of documents, this can get long. You can add view parameters to the
URI to constrain the result set. Say we know the date of a blog post.
To find a single document, we would use
\fB/blog/_design/docs/_view/by_date?key="2009/01/30 18:04:11"\fP
to get the “Biking” blog post. Remember that you can place whatever you like
in the key parameter to the emit() function. Whatever you put in there, we can
now use to look up exactly — and fast.
.sp
Note that in the case where multiple rows have the same key (perhaps we design
a view where the key is the name of the post’s author), key queries can return
more than one row.
.SS Find Many
.sp
We talked about “getting all posts for last month.” If it’s February now,
this is as easy as:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/blog/_design/docs/_view/by_date?startkey="2010/01/01 00:00:00"&endkey="2010/02/00 00:00:00"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBstartkey\fP and \fBendkey\fP parameters specify an inclusive range on which
we can search.
.sp
To make things a little nicer and to prepare for a future example, we are going
to change the format of our date field. Instead of a string, we are going to use
an array, where individual members are part of a timestamp in decreasing
significance. This sounds fancy, but it is rather easy. Instead of:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "date": "2009/01/31 00:00:00"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
we use:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "date": [2009, 1, 31, 0, 0, 0]
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Our map function does not have to change for this, but our view result looks
a little different:
.sp
Table 2. New view results:
.TS
center;
|l|l|.
_
T{
Key
T}	T{

T}
_
T{

T}	T{

_
T{
[2009, 1, 30, 18, 4, 11]
T}	T{

_

.sp
And our queries change to:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/blog/_design/docs/_view/by_date?startkey=[2010, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]&endkey=[2010, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
For all you care, this is just a change in syntax, not meaning. But it shows
you the power of views. Not only can you construct an index with scalar values
like strings and integers, you can also use JSON structures as keys for your
views. Say we tag our documents with a list of tags and want to see all tags,
but we don’t care for documents that have not been tagged.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

    ...
    tags: ["cool", "freak", "plankton"],

function(doc) {
    if(doc.tags.length > 0) {
        for(var idx in doc.tags) {
            emit(doc.tags[idx], null);
        }
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This shows a few new things. You can have conditions on structure
(\fBif(doc.tags.length > 0)\fP) instead of just values. This is also an example of
how a map function calls \fBemit()\fP multiple times per document.
And finally, you can pass null instead of a value to the value parameter.
The same is true for the key parameter. We’ll see in a bit how that is useful.
.SS Reversed Results
.sp
To retrieve view results in reverse order, use the \fBdescending=true\fP query
parameter. If you are using a \fBstartkey\fP parameter, you will find that CouchDB
returns different rows or no rows at all. What’s up with that?
.sp
It’s pretty easy to understand when you see how view query options work under
the hood. A view is stored in a tree structure for fast lookups. Whenever you
query a view, this is how CouchDB operates:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Starts reading at the top, or at the position that \fBstartkey\fP specifies,
if present.
.IP 2. 3
Returns one row at a time until the end or until it hits \fBendkey\fP,
if present.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you specify \fBdescending=true\fP, the reading direction is reversed,
not the sort  order of the rows in the view. In addition, the same two\-step
procedure is followed.
.sp
Say you have a view result that looks like this:
.TS
center;
|l|l|.
_
T{
Key
T}	T{
Value
T}
_
T{
0
T}	T{
"foo"
T}
_
T{
1
T}	T{
"bar"
T}
_
T{
2
T}	T{
"baz"
T}
_
.TE
.sp
Here are potential query options: \fB?startkey=1&descending=true\fP\&. What will
CouchDB do? See #1 above: it jumps to \fBstartkey\fP, which is the row with the
key \fB1\fP, and starts reading backward until it hits the end of the view.
So the particular result would be:
.TS
center;
|l|l|.
_
T{
Key
T}	T{
Value
T}
_
T{
1
T}	T{
"bar"
T}
_
T{
0
T}	T{
"foo"
T}
_
.TE
.sp
This is very likely not what you want. To get the rows with the indexes \fB1\fP
and \fB2\fP in reverse order, you need to switch the \fBstartkey\fP to \fBendkey\fP:
\fBendkey=1&descending=true\fP:
.TS
center;
|l|l|.
_
T{
Key
T}	T{
Value
T}
_
T{
2
T}	T{
"baz"
T}
_
T{
1
T}	T{
"bar"
T}
_
.TE
.sp
Now that looks a lot better. CouchDB started reading at the bottom of the view
and went backward until it hit \fBendkey\fP\&.
.SS The View to Get Comments for Posts
.sp
We use an array key here to support the \fBgroup_level\fP reduce query parameter.
CouchDB’s views are stored in the B\-tree file structure. Because of the way
B\-trees are structured, we can cache the intermediate reduce results in the
non\-leaf nodes of the tree, so reduce queries can be computed along arbitrary
key ranges in logarithmic time. See Figure 1, “Comments map function”.
.sp
In the blog app, we use \fBgroup_level\fP reduce queries to compute the count of
comments both on a per\-post and total basis, achieved by querying the same view
index with different methods. With some array keys, and assuming each key has

returns the total number of rows between the start and end key.
So with \fBstartkey=["a","b"]&endkey=["b"]\fP (which includes the first three of
the above keys) the result would equal \fB3\fP\&. The effect is to count rows.
If you’d like to count rows without depending on the row value, you can switch
on the \fBrereduce\fP parameter:

This is the reduce view used by the example app to count comments, while
utilizing the map to output the comments, which are more useful than just
\fB1\fP over and over. It pays to spend some time playing around with map and
reduce functions. Fauxton is OK for this, but it doesn’t give full access to
all the query parameters. Writing your own test code for views in your language
of choice is a great way to explore the nuances and capabilities of CouchDB’s
incremental MapReduce system.
.sp
Anyway, with a \fBgroup_level\fP query, you’re basically running a series of
reduce range queries: one for each group that shows up at the level you query.
Let’s reprint the key list from earlier, grouped at level \fB1\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["a"]   3
["b"]   2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

And at \fBgroup_level=2\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.ft C
["a","b"]   2
["a","c"]   1
["b","a"]   2

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Using the parameter \fBgroup=true\fP makes it behave as though it were
\fBgroup_level=999\fP, so in the case of our current example, it would give the
number \fB1\fP for each key, as there are no exactly duplicated keys.
.SS Reduce/Rereduce
.sp
We briefly talked about the \fBrereduce\fP parameter to the reduce function.
We’ll explain what’s up with it in this section. By now, you should have learned
that your view result is stored in B\-tree index structure for efficiency.
The existence and use of the \fBrereduce\fP parameter is tightly coupled to how
the B\-tree index works.
.sp
Consider the map result are:

When we want to find out how many dishes there are per origin, we can reuse
the simple reduce function shown earlier:

looks like. We abbreviated the key strings.

The view result is what computer science grads call a “pre\-order” walk through
the tree. We look at each element in each node starting from the left. Whenever
we see that there is a subnode to descend into, we descend and start reading
the elements in that subnode. When we have walked through the entire tree,
we’re done.
.sp
You can see that CouchDB stores both keys and values inside each leaf node.
In our case, it is simply always \fB1\fP, but you might have a value where you
count other results and then all rows have a different value. What’s important
is that CouchDB runs all elements that are within a node into the reduce
function (setting the \fBrereduce\fP parameter to false) and stores the result
inside the parent node along with the edge to the subnode. In our case, each
edge has a 3 representing the reduce value for the node it points to.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
In reality, nodes have more than 1,600 elements in them. CouchDB computes
the result for all the elements in multiple iterations over the elements in
a single node, not all at once (which would be disastrous for memory
consumption).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now let’s see what happens when we run a query. We want to know how many
"chinese" entries we have. The query option is simple: \fB?key="chinese"\fP\&.
See Figure 3, “The B\-tree index reduce result”.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 2.5
[image: The B-tree index reduce result]

Figure 3. The B\-tree index reduce result.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CouchDB detects that all values in the subnode include the "chinese" key.
It concludes that it can take just the 3 values associated with that node to
compute the final result. It then finds the node left to it and sees that it’s
a node with keys outside the requested range (\fBkey=\fP requests a range where
the beginning and the end are the same value). It concludes that it has to use
the "chinese" element’s value and the other node’s value and run them through
the reduce function with the \fBrereduce\fP parameter set to true.
.sp
The reduce function effectively calculates 3 + 1 at query time and returns the
desired result. The next example shows some pseudocode that shows the last
invocation of the reduce function with actual values:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(null, [3, 1], true) {
    return sum([3, 1]);
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now, we said your reduce function must actually reduce your values. If you see
the B\-tree, it should become obvious what happens when you don’t reduce your
values. Consider the following map result and reduce function. This time we
want to get a list of all the unique labels in our view:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"abc", "afrikaans"
"cef", "afrikaans"
"fhi", "chinese"
"hkl", "chinese"
"ino", "chinese"
"lqr", "chinese"
"mtu", "french"
"owx", "italian"
"qza", "italian"
"tdx", "spanish"
"xfg", "vietnamese"
"zul", "vietnamese"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
We don’t care for the key here and only list all the labels we have. Our reduce
function removes duplicates:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(keys, values, rereduce) {
    var unique_labels = {};
    values.forEach(function(label) {
        if(!unique_labels[label]) {
            unique_labels[label] = true;
        }
    });

    return unique_labels;
}
.ft P

.sp
This translates to Figure 4, “An overflowing reduce index”.
.sp
We hope you get the picture. The way the B\-tree storage works means that if you
don’t actually reduce your data in the reduce function, you end up having
CouchDB copy huge amounts of data around that grow linearly, if not faster,
with the number of rows in your view.
.sp
CouchDB will be able to compute the final result, but only for views with a few
rows. Anything larger will experience a ridiculously slow view build time.
To help with that, CouchDB since version 0.10.0 will throw an error if your
reduce function does not reduce its input values.

.UNINDENT
.SS Wrapping Up
.sp
Map functions are side effect–free functions that take a document as argument
and \fIemit\fP key/value pairs. CouchDB stores the emitted rows by constructing a
sorted B\-tree index, so row lookups by key, as well as streaming operations
across a range of rows, can be accomplished in a small memory and processing
footprint, while writes avoid seeks. Generating a view takes \fBO(N)\fP, where
\fBN\fP is the total number of rows in the view. However, querying a view is very
quick, as the B\-tree remains shallow even when it contains many, many keys.
.sp
Reduce functions operate on the sorted rows emitted by map view functions.
CouchDB’s reduce functionality takes advantage of one of the fundamental
properties of B\-tree indexes: for every leaf node (a sorted row), there is a
chain of internal nodes reaching back to the root. Each leaf node in the B\-tree
carries a few rows (on the order of tens, depending on row size), and each
internal node may link to a few leaf nodes or other internal nodes.
.sp
The reduce function is run on every node in the tree in order to calculate
the final reduce value. The end result is a reduce function that can be
incrementally updated upon changes to the map function, while recalculating
the reduction values for a minimum number of nodes. The initial reduction is
calculated once per each node (inner and leaf) in the tree.
.sp
When run on leaf nodes (which contain actual map rows), the reduce function’s
third parameter, \fBrereduce\fP, is false. The arguments in this case are the keys
and values as output by the map function. The function has a single returned
reduction value, which is stored on the inner node that a working set of leaf
nodes have in common, and is used as a cache in future reduce calculations.
.sp
When the reduce function is run on inner nodes, the \fBrereduce\fP flag is
\fBtrue\fP\&. This allows the function to account for the fact that it will be
receiving its own prior output. When \fBrereduce\fP is true, the values passed to
the function are intermediate reduction values as cached from previous
calculations. When the tree is more than two levels deep, the \fIrereduce\fP phase
is repeated, consuming chunks of the previous level’s output until the final
reduce value is calculated at the root node.
.sp
A common mistake new CouchDB users make is attempting to construct complex
aggregate values with a reduce function. Full reductions should result in a
scalar value, like 5, and not, for instance, a JSON hash with a set of unique
keys and the count of each. The problem with this approach is that you’ll end
up with a very large final value. The number of unique keys can be nearly as
large as the number of total keys, even for a large set. It is fine to combine
a few scalar calculations into one reduce function; for instance, to find the
total, average, and standard deviation of a set of numbers in a single function.
.sp
If you’re interested in pushing the edge of CouchDB’s incremental reduce
functionality, have a look at \fI\%Google’s paper on Sawzall\fP, which gives examples
of some of the more exotic reductions that can be accomplished in a system with
similar constraints.
.SS Views Collation
.SS Basics
.sp
View functions specify a key and a value to be returned for each row. CouchDB
collates the view rows by this key. In the following example, the \fBLastName\fP
property serves as the key, thus the result will be sorted by \fBLastName\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if (doc.Type == "customer") {
        emit(doc.LastName, {FirstName: doc.FirstName, Address: doc.Address});
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
CouchDB allows arbitrary JSON structures to be used as keys. You can use JSON
arrays as keys for fine\-grained control over sorting and grouping.
.SS Examples
.sp
The following clever trick would return both customer and order documents.
The key is composed of a customer \fB_id\fP and a sorting token. Because the key
for order documents begins with the \fB_id\fP of a customer document, all the
orders will be sorted by customer. Because the sorting token for customers is
lower than the token for orders, the customer document will come before the
associated orders. The values 0 and 1 for the sorting token are arbitrary.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if (doc.Type == "customer") {
        emit([doc._id, 0], null);
    } else if (doc.Type == "order") {
        emit([doc.customer_id, 1], null);
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To list a specific customer with \fB_id\fP XYZ, and all of that customer\(aqs orders,
limit the startkey and endkey ranges to cover only documents for that customer\(aqs
\fB_id\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
startkey=["XYZ"]&endkey=["XYZ", {}]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is not recommended to emit the document itself in the view. Instead, to
include the bodies of the documents when requesting the view, request the view
with \fB?include_docs=true\fP\&.
.SS Sorting by Dates
.sp
It maybe be convenient to store date attributes in a human readable format
(i.e. as a \fIstring\fP), but still sort by date. This can be done by converting
the date to a \fInumber\fP in the \fBemit()\fP function. For example, given
a document with a created_at attribute of \fB\(aqWed Jul 23 16:29:21 +0100 2013\(aq\fP,
the following emit function would sort by date:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
emit(Date.parse(doc.created_at).getTime(), null);
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively, if you use a date format which sorts lexicographically,
such as \fB"2013/06/09 13:52:11 +0000"\fP you can just
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
emit(doc.created_at, null);
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and avoid the conversion. As a bonus, this date format is compatible with the
JavaScript date parser, so you can use \fBnew Date(doc.created_at)\fP in your
client side JavaScript to make date sorting easy in the browser.
.SS String Ranges
.sp
If you need start and end keys that encompass every string with a given prefix,
it is better to use a high value unicode character, than to use a \fB\(aqZZZZ\(aq\fP
suffix.
.sp
That is, rather than:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.SS Key ranges

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
startkey="Abc"&endkey="AbcZZZZ"
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

will match "ABC" and "abc1", but not "abc". This is because UCA sorts as:

.nf
.ft C
abc < Abc < ABC < abc1 < AbcZZZZZ
.ft P

.UNINDENT

For most applications, to avoid problems you should lowercase the \fIstartkey\fP:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
startkey="abc"&endkey="abcZZZZZZZZ"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will match all keys starting with \fB[aA][bB][cC]\fP
.SS Complex keys
.sp
The query \fBstartkey=["foo"]&endkey=["foo",{}]\fP will match most array keys
with "foo" in the first element, such as \fB["foo","bar"]\fP and
\fB["foo",["bar","baz"]]\fP\&. However it will not match \fB["foo",{"an":"object"}]\fP
.SS _all_docs
.sp
The \fI_all_docs\fP  view is a special case because it uses
ASCII collation for doc ids, not UCA:

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
startkey="_design/"&endkey="_design/ZZZZZZZZ"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

will not find \fB_design/abc\fP because \fI\(aqZ\(aq\fP comes before \fI\(aqa\(aq\fP in the ASCII

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
startkey="_design/"&endkey="_design0"
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Raw collation
.sp
To squeeze a little more performance out of views, you can specify
\fB"options":{"collation":"raw"}\fP  within the view definition for native Erlang
collation, especially if you don\(aqt require UCA. This gives a different collation
sequence:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Beware that \fB{}\fP is no longer a suitable "high" key sentinel value. Use a

.SS Joins With Views
.SS Linked Documents
.sp
If your \fImap function\fP emits an object value which has
\fB{\(aq_id\(aq: XXX}\fP and you \fIquery view\fP with
\fBinclude_docs=true\fP parameter, then CouchDB will fetch the document with id
\fBXXX\fP rather than the document which was processed to emit the key/value pair.
.sp
This means that if one document contains the ids of other documents, it can
cause those documents to be fetched in the view too, adjacent to the same key
if required.
.sp
For example, if you have the following hierarchically\-linked documents:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[
    { "_id": "11111" },
    { "_id": "22222", "ancestors": ["11111"], "value": "hello" },
    { "_id": "33333", "ancestors": ["22222","11111"], "value": "world" }
]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can emit the values with the ancestor documents adjacent to them in the view
like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if (doc.value) {
        emit([doc.value, 0], null);
        if (doc.ancestors) {
            for (var i in doc.ancestors) {
                emit([doc.value, Number(i)+1], {_id: doc.ancestors[i]});
            }
        }
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

The result you get is:

which makes it very cheap to fetch a document plus all its ancestors in one
query.

Note that the \fB"id"\fP in the row is still that of the originating document.
The only difference is that \fBinclude_docs\fP fetches a different doc.

The current revision of the document is resolved at query time, not at the time
the view is generated. This means that if a new revision of the linked document
is added later, it will appear in view queries even though the view itself

.sp
Just today, there was a discussion on IRC on how you\(aqd go about modeling a
simple blogging system with “post” and “comment” entities, where any blog
post might have N comments. If you\(aqd be using an SQL database, you\(aqd obviously
have two tables with foreign keys and you\(aqd be using joins. (At least until you
needed to add some \fI\%denormalization\fP).
.sp
But what would the “obvious” approach in CouchDB look like?
.SS Approach #1: Comments Inlined
.sp
A simple approach would be to have one document per blog post, and store the
comments inside that document:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "myslug",
    "_rev": "123456",
    "author": "john",
    "title": "My blog post",
    "content": "Bla bla bla …",
    "comments": [
        {"author": "jack", "content": "…"},
        {"author": "jane", "content": "…"}
    ]
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Of course the model of an actual blogging system would be more extensive,
you\(aqd have tags, timestamps, etc, etc. This is just to demonstrate the basics.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The obvious advantage of this approach is that the data that belongs together
is stored in one place. Delete the post, and you automatically delete the
corresponding comments, and so on.
.sp
You may be thinking that putting the comments inside the blog post document
would not allow us to query for the comments themselves, but you\(aqd be wrong.
You could trivially write a CouchDB view that would return all comments across
all blog posts, keyed by author:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    for (var i in doc.comments) {
        emit(doc.comments[i].author, doc.comments[i].content);
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now you could list all comments by a particular user by invoking the view and
passing it a \fB?key="username"\fP query string parameter.
.sp
However, this approach has a drawback that can be quite significant for many
applications: To add a comment to a post, you need to:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Fetch the blog post document
.IP \(bu 2
Add the new comment to the JSON structure
.IP \(bu 2
Send the updated document to the server
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now if you have multiple client processes adding comments at roughly the same
time, some of them will get a \fIHTTP 409 Conflict\fP error on step 3 (that\(aqs
optimistic concurrency in action). For some applications this makes sense, but
in many other apps, you\(aqd want to append new related data regardless of whether
other data has been added in the meantime.
.sp
The only way to allow non\-conflicting addition of related data is by putting
that related data into separate documents.
.SS Approach #2: Comments Separate
.sp
Using this approach you\(aqd have one document per blog post, and one document per
comment. The comment documents would have a “backlink” to the post they belong
to.
.sp
The blog post document would look similar to the above, minus the comments
property. Also, we\(aqd now have a type property on all our documents so that we
can tell the difference between posts and comments:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "myslug",
    "_rev": "123456",
    "type": "post",
    "author": "john",
    "title": "My blog post",
    "content": "Bla bla bla …"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The comments themselves are stored in separate documents, which also have a type
property (this time with the value “comment”), and additionally feature a post
property containing the ID of the post document they belong to:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "ABCDEF",
    "_rev": "123456",
    "type": "comment",
    "post": "myslug",
    "author": "jack",
    "content": "…"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "DEFABC",
    "_rev": "123456",
    "type": "comment",
    "post": "myslug",
    "author": "jane",
    "content": "…"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To list all comments per blog post, you\(aqd add a simple view, keyed by blog post
ID:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if (doc.type == "comment") {
        emit(doc.post, {author: doc.author, content: doc.content});
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And you\(aqd invoke that view passing it a \fB?key="post_id"\fP query string
parameter.
.sp
Viewing all comments by author is just as easy as before:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if (doc.type == "comment") {
        emit(doc.author, {post: doc.post, content: doc.content});
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
So this is better in some ways, but it also has a disadvantage.
Imagine you want to display a blog post with all the associated comments on the
same web page. With our first approach, we needed just a single request to the
CouchDB server, namely a \fBGET\fP request to the document. With this second
approach, we need two requests: a \fBGET\fP request to the post document, and a
\fBGET\fP request to the view that returns all comments for the post.
.sp
That is okay, but not quite satisfactory. Just imagine you wanted to add
threaded comments: you\(aqd now need an additional fetch per comment. What we\(aqd
probably want then would be a way to join the blog post and the various comments
together to be able to retrieve them with a single HTTP request.
.sp
This was when Damien Katz, the author of CouchDB, chimed in to the discussion
on IRC to show us the way.
.SS Optimization: Using the Power of View Collation
.sp
Obvious to Damien, but not at all obvious to the rest of us: it\(aqs fairly simple
to make a view that includes both the content of the blog post document, and
the content of all the comments associated with that post. The way you do that
is by using \fIcomplex keys\fP\&. Until now we\(aqve been using simple string values for
the view keys, but in fact they can be arbitrary JSON values, so let\(aqs make
some use of that:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if (doc.type == "post") {
        emit([doc._id, 0], doc);
    } else if (doc.type == "comment") {
        emit([doc.post, 1], doc);
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Okay, this may be confusing at first. Let\(aqs take a step back and look at what
views in CouchDB are really about.
.sp
CouchDB views are basically highly efficient on\-disk dictionaries that map keys
to values, where the key is automatically indexed and can be used to filter
and/or sort the results you get back from your views. When you “invoke” a view,
you can say that you\(aqre only interested in a subset of the view rows by
specifying a \fB?key=foo\fP query string parameter. Or you can specify
\fB?startkey=foo\fP and/or \fB?endkey=bar\fP query string parameters to fetch rows
over a range of keys.
.sp
It\(aqs also important to note that keys are always used for collating (i.e.
sorting) the rows. CouchDB has well defined (but as of yet undocumented) rules
for comparing arbitrary JSON objects for collation. For example, the JSON value
\fB["foo", 2]\fP is sorted after (considered “greater than”) the values
\fB["foo"]\fP or \fB["foo", 1, "bar"]\fP, but before e.g. \fB["foo", 2, "bar"]\fP\&.
This feature enables a whole class of tricks that are rather non\-obvious...

\fIviews/collation\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
With that in mind, let\(aqs return to the view function above. First note that,
unlike the previous view functions we\(aqve used here, this view handles both
"post" and "comment" documents, and both of them end up as rows in the same
view. Also, the key in this view is not just a simple string, but an array.
The first element in that array is always the ID of the post, regardless of
whether we\(aqre processing an actual post document, or a comment associated with
a post. The second element is 0 for post documents, and 1 for comment documents.
.sp
Let\(aqs assume we have two blog posts in our database. Without limiting the view
results via \fBkey\fP, \fBstartkey\fP, or \fBendkey\fP, we\(aqd get back something like
the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "total_rows": 5, "offset": 0, "rows": [{
            "id": "myslug",
            "key": ["myslug", 0],
            "value": {...}
        }, {
            "id": "ABCDEF",
            "key": ["myslug", 1],
            "value": {...}
        }, {
            "id": "DEFABC",
            "key": ["myslug", 1],
            "value": {...}
        }, {
            "id": "other_slug",
            "key": ["other_slug", 0],
            "value": {...}
        }, {
            "id": "CDEFAB",
            "key": ["other_slug", 1],
            "value": {...}
        },
    ]
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The \fB\&...\fP placeholders here would contain the complete JSON encoding of the
corresponding documents
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now, to get a specific blog post and all associated comments, we\(aqd invoke that
view with the query string:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
?startkey=["myslug"]&endkey;=["myslug", 2]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
We\(aqd get back the first three rows, those that belong to the \fBmyslug\fP post,
but not the others. Et voila, we now have the data we need to display a post
with all associated comments, retrieved via a single \fBGET\fP request.
.sp
You may be asking what the 0 and 1 parts of the keys are for. They\(aqre simply
to ensure that the post document is always sorted before the the associated
comment documents. So when you get back the results from this view for a
specific post, you\(aqll know that the first row contains the data for the blog
post itself, and the remaining rows contain the comment data.
.sp
One remaining problem with this model is that comments are not ordered, but
that\(aqs simply because we don\(aqt have date/time information associated with them.
If we had, we\(aqd add the timestamp as third element of the key array, probably
as ISO date/time strings. Now we would continue using the query string
\fB?startkey=["myslug"]&endkey=["myslug", 2]\fP to fetch the blog post and all
associated comments, only now they\(aqd be in chronological order.
.SS View Cookbook for SQL Jockeys
.sp
This is a collection of some common SQL queries and how to get the same result
in CouchDB. The key to remember here is that CouchDB does not work like an SQL
database at all, and that best practices from the SQL world do not translate
well or at all to CouchDB. This document’s “cookbook” assumes that you are
familiar with the CouchDB basics such as creating and updating databases and
documents.

How you can do this in CouchDB?

Using views is a two\-step process. First you define a view; then you query it.
This is analogous to defining a table structure (with indexes) using
\fBCREATE TABLE\fP or \fBALTER TABLE\fP and querying it using an SQL query.
.SS Defining a View
.sp
Defining a view is done by creating a special document in a CouchDB database.
The only real specialness is the \fB_id\fP of the document, which starts with
\fB_design/\fP — for example, _design/application. Other than that, it is just a
regular CouchDB document. To make sure CouchDB understands that you are defining
a view, you need to prepare the contents of that design document in a special
format. Here is an example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "_design/application",
    "_rev": "1\-C1687D17",
    "views": {
        "viewname": {
            "map": "function(doc) { ... }",
            "reduce": "function(keys, values) { ... }"
        }
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
We are defining a view \fIviewname\fP\&. The definition of the view consists of two
functions: the map function and the reduce function. Specifying a reduce
function is optional. We’ll look at the nature of the functions later. Note that
\fIviewname\fP can be whatever you like: \fBusers\fP, \fBby\-name\fP, or \fBby\-date\fP are
just some examples.
.sp
A single design document can also include multiple view definitions, each
identified by a unique name:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id": "_design/application",
    "_rev": "1\-C1687D17",
    "views": {
        "viewname": {
            "map": "function(doc) { ... }",
            "reduce": "function(keys, values) { ... }"
        },
        "anotherview": {
            "map": "function(doc) { ... }",
            "reduce": "function(keys, values) { ... }"
        }
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Querying a View
.sp
The name of the design document and the name of the view are significant for
querying the view. To query the view \fIviewname\fP, you perform an HTTP \fBGET\fP
request to the following URI:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/database/_design/application/_view/viewname
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
database is the name of the database you created your design document in. Next
up is the design document name, and then the view name prefixed with \fB_view/\fP\&.
To query \fIanotherview\fP, replace \fIviewname\fP in that URI with \fIanotherview\fP\&.
If you want to query a view in a different design document, adjust the design
document name.
.SS MapReduce Functions
.sp
MapReduce is a concept that solves problems by applying a two\-step process,
aptly named the map phase and the reduce phase. The map phase looks at all
documents in CouchDB separately one after the other and creates a \fImap result\fP\&.
The map result is an ordered list of key/value pairs. Both key and value can
be specified by the user writing the map function. A map function may call the
built\-in \fBemit(key, value)\fP function 0 to N times per document, creating a row
in the map result per invocation.
.sp
CouchDB is smart enough to run a map function only once for every document, even
on subsequent queries on a view. Only changes to documents or new documents need
to be processed anew.
.SS Map functions
.sp
Map functions run in isolation for every document. They can’t modify the
document, and they can’t talk to the outside world—they can’t have side effects.
This is required so that CouchDB can guarantee correct results without having
to recalculate a complete result when only one document gets changed.
.sp
The map result looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{"total_rows":3,"offset":0,"rows":[
{"id":"fc2636bf50556346f1ce46b4bc01fe30","key":"Lena","value":5},
{"id":"1fb2449f9b9d4e466dbfa47ebe675063","key":"Lisa","value":4},
{"id":"8ede09f6f6aeb35d948485624b28f149","key":"Sarah","value":6}
]}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is a list of rows sorted by the value of key. The id is added automatically
and refers back to the document that created this row. The value is the data
you’re looking for. For example purposes, it’s the girl’s age.
.sp
The map function that produces this result is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if(doc.name && doc.age) {
        emit(doc.name, doc.age);
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It includes the if statement as a sanity check to ensure that we’re operating
on the right fields and calls the emit function with the name and age as the key
and value.
.SS Look Up by Key
.sp
How you would do this in SQL:

.sp

SELECT field FROM table WHERE value="searchterm"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
How you can do this in CouchDB?
.sp
Use case: get a result (which can be a record or set of records) associated
with a key ("searchterm").
.sp
To look something up quickly, regardless of the storage mechanism, an index is
needed. An index is a data structure optimized for quick search and retrieval.
CouchDB’s map result is stored in such an index, which happens to be a B+ tree.
.sp
To look up a value by "searchterm", we need to put all values into the key of a
view. All we need is a simple map function:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if(doc.value) {
        emit(doc.value, null);
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This creates a list of documents that have a value field sorted by the data in
the value field. To find all the records that match "searchterm", we query the
view and specify the search term as a query parameter:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/database/_design/application/_view/viewname?key="searchterm"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Consider the documents from the previous section, and say we’re indexing on the
age field of the documents to find all the five\-year\-olds:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if(doc.age && doc.name) {
        emit(doc.age, doc.name);
    }
}

]}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Easy.
.sp
Note that you have to emit a value. The view result includes the associated
document ID in every row. We can use it to look up more data from the document
itself. We can also use the \fB?include_docs=true\fP parameter to have CouchDB
fetch the individual documents for us.

\fIsearchterm\fP\&. For example, say you stored a MIME type (like \fItext/html\fP or
\fIimage/jpg\fP) for each document and now you want to find all documents that are
images according to the MIME type.
.sp
The solution is very similar to the previous example: all we need is a map
function that is a little more clever than the first one. But first, an example
document:

We haven’t explained reduce functions yet. Reduce functions are similar to
aggregate functions in SQL. They compute a value over multiple documents.
.sp
To explain the mechanics of reduce functions, we’ll create one that doesn’t make
a whole lot of sense. But this example is easy to understand. We’ll explore more
useful reductions later.
.sp
Reduce functions operate on the output of the map function (also called the map
result or intermediate result). The reduce function’s job, unsurprisingly, is to
reduce the list that the map function produces.
.sp
Here’s what our summing reduce function looks like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(keys, values) {
    var sum = 0;

This reduce function takes two arguments: a list of keys and a list of values.
For our summing purposes we can ignore the keys\-list and consider only the value
list. We’re looping over the list and add each item to a running total that
we’re returning at the end of the function.
.sp
You’ll see one difference between the map and the reduce function. The map
function uses \fBemit()\fP to create its result, whereas the reduce function
returns a value.
.sp
For example, from a list of integer values that specify the age, calculate the
sum of all years of life for the news headline,
\fI“786 life years present at event.”\fP A little contrived, but very simple and
thus good for demonstration purposes. Consider the documents and the map view we
used earlier in this document.
.sp
The reduce function to calculate the total age of all girls is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft C
function(keys, values) {
    return sum(values);
}

.UNINDENT

.sp
Note that, instead of the two earlier versions, we use CouchDB’s predefined
\fBsum()\fP function. It does the same thing as the other two, but it is such
a common piece of code that CouchDB has it included.
.sp
The result for our reduce view now looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{"rows":[
    {"key":null,"value":15}

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The total sum of all age fields in all our documents is 15. Just what we wanted.
The key member of the result object is null, as we can’t know anymore which
documents took part in the creation of the reduced result. We’ll cover more
advanced reduce cases later on.
.sp
As a rule of thumb, the reduce function should reduce to a single scalar value.
That is, an integer; a string; or a small, fixed\-size list or object that
includes an aggregated value (or values) from the values argument.
It should never just return values or similar. CouchDB will give you a warning

Getting unique values is not as easy as adding a keyword. But a reduce view and
a special query parameter give us the same result. Let’s say you want a list of
tags that your users have tagged themselves with and no duplicates.
.sp
First, let’s look at the source documents. We punt on \fB_id\fP and \fB_rev\fP
attributes here:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "name":"Chris",

}

    "name":"Jan",
    "tags":["drums", "bike", "couchdb"]
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Next, we need a list of all tags. A map function will do the trick:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if(doc.name && doc.tags) {
        doc.tags.forEach(function(tag) {
            emit(tag, null);
        });
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The result will look like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{"total_rows":9,"offset":0,"rows":[

.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As promised, these are all the tags, including duplicates. Since each document
gets run through the map function in isolation, it cannot know if the same key
has been emitted already. At this stage, we need to live with that. To achieve
uniqueness, we need a reduce:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(keys, values) {
    return true;
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This reduce doesn’t do anything, but it allows us to specify a special query
parameter when querying the view:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
/dudes/_design/dude\-data/_view/tags?group=true

{"key":"philosophy","value":true}

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case, we can ignore the value part because it is always true, but the
result includes a list of all our tags and no duplicates!
.sp
With a small change we can put the reduce to good use, too. Let’s see how many
of the non\-unique tags are there for each tag. To calculate the tag frequency,
we just use the summing up we already learned about. In the map function,
we emit a 1 instead of null:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if(doc.name && doc.tags) {
        doc.tags.forEach(function(tag) {
            emit(tag, 1);
        });
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the reduce function, we return the sum of all values:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(keys, values) {
    return sum(values);
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

Now, if we query the view with the \fB?group=true\fP parameter, we get back the
count for each tag:
.INDENT 0.0

Use case: your applications require that a certain value exists only once in a

.sp
This is an easy one: within a CouchDB database, each document must have a
unique \fB_id\fP field. If you require unique values in a database, just assign
them to a document’s \fB_id\fP field and CouchDB will enforce uniqueness for you.
.sp
There’s one caveat, though: in the distributed case, when you are running more
than one CouchDB node that accepts write requests, uniqueness can be guaranteed
only per node or outside of CouchDB. CouchDB will allow two identical IDs to be
written to two different nodes. On replication, CouchDB will detect a conflict
and flag the document accordingly.
.SS Pagination Recipe
.sp
This recipe explains how to paginate over view results.
Pagination is a user interface (UI) pattern that allows the display of a
large number of rows (\fIthe result set\fP) without loading all the rows into the
UI at once. A fixed\-size subset, the \fIpage\fP, is displayed along with next and
previous links or buttons that can move the \fIviewport\fP over the result set to
an adjacent page.
.sp
We assume you’re familiar with creating and querying documents and views as
well as the multiple view query options.
.SS Example Data
.sp
To have some data to work with, we’ll create a list of bands,
one document per band:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "name":"Biffy Clyro" }

{ "name":"Foo Fighters" }

{ "name":"Future of the Left" }

{ "name":"Silverchair" }

{ "name":"Queens of the Stone Age" }

{ "name":"Kerub" }
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS A View
.sp
We need a simple map function that gives us an alphabetical list of band
names. This should be easy, but we’re adding extra smarts to filter out “The”
and “A” in front of band names to put them into the right position:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    if(doc.name) {
        var name = doc.name.replace(/^(A|The) /, "");
        emit(name, null);
    }
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The views result is an alphabetical list of band names. Now say we want to
display band names five at a time and have a link pointing to the next five
names that make up one page, and a link for the previous five,
if we’re not on the first page.
.sp

earlier documents. We’ll use these again here. First, let’s have a look at

.SS Paging (Alternate Method)
.sp
The method described above performed poorly with large skip values until
CouchDB 1.2. Additionally, some use cases may call for the following
alternate method even with newer versions of CouchDB. One such case is when
duplicate results should be prevented. Using skip alone it is possible for
new documents to be inserted during pagination which could change the offset
of the start of the subsequent page.
.sp
A correct solution is not much harder. Instead of slicing the result set
into equally sized pages, we look at 10 rows at a time and use \fBstartkey\fP to
jump to the next 10 rows. We even use skip, but only with the value 1.
.sp
Here is how it works:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Request \fIrows_per_page + 1\fP rows from the view
.IP \(bu 2
Display \fIrows_per_page\fP rows, \fIstore + 1\fP row as \fInext_startkey\fP and
\fInext_startkey_docid\fP
.IP \(bu 2
As page information, keep \fBstartkey\fP and \fInext_startkey\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Use the \fInext_*\fP values to create the next link, and use the others to
create the previous link
.UNINDENT
.sp
The trick to finding the next page is pretty simple. Instead of requesting 10
rows for a page, you request 11 rows, but display only 10 and use the values
in the 11th row as the \fBstartkey\fP for the next page. Populating the link to
the previous page is as simple as carrying the current \fBstartkey\fP over to the
next page. If there’s no previous \fBstartkey\fP, we are on the first page. We
stop displaying the link to the next page if we get \fIrows_per_page\fP or less
rows back. This is called linked list pagination, as we go from page to
page, or list item to list item, instead of jumping directly to a
pre\-computed page. There is one caveat, though. Can you spot it?
.sp
CouchDB view keys do not have to be unique; you can have multiple index
entries read. What if you have more index entries for a key than rows that
should be on a page? \fBstartkey\fP jumps to the first row, and you’d be screwed
if CouchDB didn’t have an additional parameter for you to use. All view keys
with the same value are internally sorted by \fIdocid\fP, that is, the ID of
the document that created that view row. You can use the \fBstartkey_docid\fP
and \fBendkey_docid\fP parameters to get subsets of these rows. For
pagination, we still don’t need \fBendkey_docid\fP, but \fBstartkey_docid\fP is very
handy. In addition to \fBstartkey\fP and \fBlimit\fP, you also use
\fBstartkey_docid\fP for pagination if, and only if, the extra row you fetch to
find the next page has the same key as the current \fBstartkey\fP\&.
.sp
It is important to note that the \fI*_docid\fP parameters only work in addition to
the \fI*key\fP parameters and are only useful to further narrow down the result set
of a view for a single key. They do not work on their own (the one exception
being the built\-in \fI_all_docs view\fP  that already sorts
by document ID).
.sp
The advantage of this approach is that all the key operations can be
performed on the super\-fast B\-tree index behind the view. Looking up a page
doesn’t include scanning through hundreds and thousands of rows unnecessarily.
.SS Jump to Page
.sp
One drawback of the linked list style pagination is that you can’t
pre\-compute the rows for a particular page from the page number and the rows
per page. Jumping to a specific page doesn’t really work. Our gut reaction,
if that concern is raised, is, “Not even Google is doing that!” and we tend
to get away with it. Google always pretends on the first page to find 10 more
pages of results. Only if you click on the second page (something very few
people actually do) might Google display a reduced set of pages. If you page
through the results, you get links for the previous and next 10 pages,
but no more. Pre\-computing the necessary \fBstartkey\fP and \fBstartkey_docid\fP
for 20 pages is a feasible operation and a pragmatic optimization to know the
rows for every page in a result set that is potentially tens of thousands
of rows long, or more.
.sp
If you really do need to jump to a page over the full range of documents (we
have seen applications that require that), you can still maintain an integer
value index as the view index and take a hybrid approach at solving pagination.

.UNINDENT
.sp
For a bit of background, CouchDB has had an API for managing \fI\%external OS
processes\fP that are capable of handling HTTP requests for a given
URL prefix. These OS processes communicate with CouchDB using JSON over
stdio. They\(aqre dead simple to write and provide CouchDB users an easy way to
extend CouchDB functionality.
.sp
Even though they\(aqre dead simple to write, there are a few issues. The
implementation in CouchDB does not provide fancy pooling semantics. The
current API is explicitly synchronous which prevents people from writing
event driven code in an external handler. In the end, they may be simple,
but their simplicity is also quite limiting.
.sp
During CouchCamp a few weeks ago I had multiple discussions with various people
that wanted to see the _externals API modified in slight ways that weren\(aqt
mutually compatible. After having multiple discussions with multiple people
we formed a general consensus on what a new API could look like.
.SS The New Hotness
.sp
So the first idea for improving the _external API was to make CouchDB act as
a reverse proxy. This would allow people to write an HTTP server that was as
simple or as complicated as they wanted. It will allow people to change their
networking configuration more easily and also allow for external processes to
be hosted on nodes other than the one running CouchDB. Bottom line, it not
only allows us to have similar semantics as _externals, it provides a lot more
fringe benefits as well. I\(aqm always a fan of extra awesomeness.
.sp
After hitting on the idea of adding a reverse proxy, people quickly pointed
out that it would require users to start manually managing their external
processes using something like \fI\%Runit\fP or \fI\%Supervisord\fP\&. After some
more discussions I ran into people that wanted something like _externals that
didn\(aqt handle HTTP requests. After that it was easy to see that adding a second
feature that managed OS processes was the way to go.
.sp
I spent this weekend implementing both of these features. Both are at the stage
of working but requiring more testing. In the case of the HTTP proxy I have no
tests because I can\(aqt decide how to test the thing. If you have ideas, I\(aqd
sure like to hear them.
.sp
\fB[Update]\fP: I woke up the other morning realizing that I was being an idiot
and that Erlang is awesome. There\(aqs no reason that I can\(aqt have an HTTP client,
proxy, and server all hosted in the same process. So that\(aqs what I did. It
turns out to be a fairly nice way of configuring matching assertions between
the client and the server to test the proxy transmissions.
.SS How does it work? \- HTTP Proxying
.sp
To configure a \fIproxy handler\fP, edit your \fIlocal.ini\fP and
add a section like such:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[httpd_global_handlers]
_fti = {couch_httpd_proxy, handle_proxy_req, <<"http://127.0.0.1:5985">>}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This would be approximately what you\(aqd need to do to get \fI\%CouchDB\-Lucene\fP
handled through this interface. The URL you use to access a query would be:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fI\%http://127.0.0.1:5984/_fti/db_name/_design/foo/by_content?q=hello\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A couple things to note here. Anything in the path after the configured proxy
name ("_fti" in this case) will be appended to the configured destination URL
("\fI\%http://127.0.0.1:5985\fP" in this case). The query string and any associated
body will also be proxied transparently.
.sp
Also, of note is that there\(aqs nothing that limits on what resources can be
proxied. You\(aqre free to choose any destination that the CouchDB node is capable
of communicating with.
.SS How does it work? \- OS Daemons
.sp
The second part of the new API gives CouchDB simple OS process management. When
CouchDB boots it will start each configured OS daemon. If one of these daemons
fails at some point, it will be restarted. If one of these daemons fails too
often, CouchDB will stop attempting to start it.
.sp
OS daemons are one\-to\-one. For each daemon, CouchDB will make sure that exactly
one instance of it is alive. If you have something where you want multiple
processes, you need to either tell CouchDB about each one, or have a main
process that forks off the required sub\-processes.
.sp
To configure an \fBOS daemon\fP, add this to your
\fIlocal.ini\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[os_daemons]
my_daemon = /path/to/command \-with args
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Configuration API
.sp
As an added benefit, because stdio is now free, I implemented a simple API
that OS daemons can use to read the configuration of their CouchDB host. This
way you can have them store their configuration inside CouchDB\(aqs config system
if you desire. Or they can peek at things like the
\fBhttpd/bind_address\fP and \fBhttpd/port\fP that CouchDB
is using.
.sp
A request for a config section looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["get", "os_daemons"]\en
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And the response:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{"my_daemon": "/path/to/command \-with args"}\en
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or to get a specific key:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["get", "os_daemons", "my_daemon"]\en
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And the response:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"/path/to/command \-with args"\en
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
All requests and responses are terminated with a newline (indicated by \fB\en\fP).
.SS Logging API
.sp
There\(aqs also an API for adding messages to CouchDB\(aqs logs. Its simply:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["log", $MESG]\en
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Where \fB$MESG\fP is any arbitrary JSON. There is no response from this command. As
with the config API, the trailing \fB\en\fP represents a newline byte.
.SS Dynamic Daemons
.sp
The OS daemons react in real time to changes to the configuration system. If
you set or delete keys in the \fBos_daemons\fP section,
the corresponding daemons will be started or killed as appropriate.
.SS Neat. But So What?
.sp
It was suggested that a good first demo would be a \fI\%Node.js\fP handler. So, I
present to you a "Hello, World" Node.js handler. Also, remember that this
currently relies on code in my fork on \fI\%GitHub\fP\&.
.sp
File \fInode\-hello\-world.js\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
var http = require(\(aqhttp\(aq);
var sys = require(\(aqsys\(aq);

// Send a log message to be included in CouchDB\(aqs
// log files.

var log = function(mesg) {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(["log", mesg]));
}

// The Node.js example HTTP server

var server = http.createServer(function (req, resp) {
    resp.writeHead(200, {\(aqContent\-Type\(aq: \(aqtext/plain\(aq});
    resp.end(\(aqHello World\en\(aq);
    log(req.method + " " + req.url);
})

// We use stdin in a couple ways. First, we
// listen for data that will be the requested
// port information. We also listen for it
// to close which indicates that CouchDB has
// exited and that means its time for us to
// exit as well.

var stdin = process.openStdin();

stdin.on(\(aqdata\(aq, function(d) {
    server.listen(parseInt(JSON.parse(d)));
});

stdin.on(\(aqend\(aq, function () {
    process.exit(0);
});

// Send the request for the port to listen on.

console.log(JSON.stringify(["get", "node_hello", "port"]));

.SH QUERY SERVER
.sp
The \fIQuery server\fP is an external process that communicates with CouchDB by JSON
protocol through stdio interface and processed all
\fIdesign functions\fP calls:
\fIviews\fP, \fIshows\fP, \fIlists\fP and more.
.sp
The default query server is written in
\fIJavaScript\fP, running via \fI\%Mozilla SpiderMonkey\fP\&.
You can use other languages by setting a Query server key in the \fBlanguage\fP
property of a design document or the \fIContent\-Type\fP header of a
\fItemporary view\fP\&. Design documents that do not specify a \fBlanguage\fP property
are assumed to be of type \fIjavascript\fP\&.
.SS Query Server Protocol
.sp
The \fIQuery Server\fP is an external process that communicates with CouchDB via a
JSON protocol over stdio  and processes all design functions calls:
\fIviews\fP, \fIshows\fP, \fIlists\fP, \fIfilters\fP, \fIupdates\fP and \fIvalidate_doc_update\fP\&.
.sp
CouchDB communicates with the Query Server process though stdio interface by
JSON messages that terminated by newline character. Messages that are sent to
the Query Server are always \fIarray\fP\-typed that could be matched by the pattern
\fB[<command>, <*arguments>]\en\fP\&.

Array. See below for details.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Executes \fIlist function\fP\&.
.sp
The communication protocol for \fIlist\fP functions is a bit complex so let\(aqs use
an example for illustration.
.sp
Let\(aqs assume that we have view a function that emits \fIid\-rev\fP pairs:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(doc) {
    emit(doc._id, doc._rev);
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And we\(aqd like to emulate \fB_all_docs\fP JSON response with list function. Our
\fIfirst\fP version of the list functions looks like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(head, req){
    start({\(aqheaders\(aq: {\(aqContent\-Type\(aq: \(aqapplication/json\(aq}});
    var resp = head;
    var rows = [];
    while(row=getRow()){
        rows.push(row);
    }
    resp.rows = rows;
    return toJSON(resp);
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The whole communication session during list function execution could be divided
on three parts:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Initialization
.sp
The first returned object from list function is an array of next structure:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["start", <chunks>, <headers>]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Where \fB<chunks>\fP is an array of text chunks that will be sent to client
and \fB<headers>\fP is an object with response HTTP headers.
.sp
This message is sent from the Query Server to CouchDB on the
\fBstart()\fP call which initialize HTTP response to the client:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[
    "start",
    [],
    {
        "headers": {
            "Content\-Type": "application/json"
        }
    }
]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After this, the list function may start to process view rows.
.IP 2. 3
View Processing
.sp
Since view results can be extremely large, it is not wise to pass all its
rows in a single command. Instead, CouchDB can send view rows one by one
to the Query Server allowing processing view and output generation in a
streaming way.
.sp
CouchDB sends a special array that carries view row data:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[
    "list_row",
    {
        "id": "0cb42c267fe32d4b56b3500bc503e030",
        "key": "0cb42c267fe32d4b56b3500bc503e030",
        "value": "1\-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d"
    }
]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If Query Server has something to return on this, it returns an array with a
\fB"chunks"\fP item in the head and an array of data in the tail. Now, for our
case it has nothing to return, so the response will be:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[
  "chunks",
  []
]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
When there is no more view rows to process, CouchDB sends special message,
that signs about that there is no more data to send from its side:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["list_end"]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP 3. 3
Finalization
.sp
The last stage of the communication process is the returning \fIlist tail\fP:
the last data chunk. After this, processing list function will be completed
and client will receive complete response.
.sp
For our example the last message will be the next:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[
    "end",
    [
        "{\e"total_rows\e":2,\e"offset\e":0,\e"rows\e":[{\e"id\e":\e"0cb42c267fe32d4b56b3500bc503e030\e",\e"key\e":\e"0cb42c267fe32d4b56b3500bc503e030\e",\e"value\e":\e"1\-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d\e"},{\e"id\e":\e"431926a69504bde41851eb3c18a27b1f\e",\e"key\e":\e"431926a69504bde41851eb3c18a27b1f\e",\e"value\e":\e"1\-967a00dff5e02add41819138abb3284d\e"}]}"

There, we had made a big mistake: we had returned out result in a single
message from the Query Server. That\(aqs ok when there are only a few rows in the
view result, but it\(aqs not acceptable for millions documents and millions view
rows
.sp
Let\(aqs fix our list function and see the changes in communication:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
function(head, req){
    start({\(aqheaders\(aq: {\(aqContent\-Type\(aq: \(aqapplication/json\(aq}});
    send(\(aq{\(aq);
    send(\(aq"total_rows":\(aq + toJSON(head.total_rows) + \(aq,\(aq);
    send(\(aq"offset":\(aq + toJSON(head.offset) + \(aq,\(aq);
    send(\(aq"rows":[\(aq);
    if (row=getRow()){
        send(toJSON(row));
    }
    while(row=getRow()){
        send(\(aq,\(aq + toJSON(row));
    }
    send(\(aq]\(aq);
    return \(aq}\(aq;

Note, that now the Query Server sends response by lightweight chunks and if
our communication process was extremely slow, the client will see how response
data appears on their screen. Chunk by chunk, without waiting for the complete
result, like they have for our previous list function.

.SS Raising errors
.sp
When something went wrong the Query Server is able to inform CouchDB about
such a situation by sending special message in response of received command.
.sp
Error messages prevent further command execution and return an error description
to CouchDB. All errors are logically divided into two groups:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fICommon errors\fP\&. These errors only break the current Query Server command and
return the error info to the CouchDB instance \fIwithout\fP terminating the Query
Server  process.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIFatal errors\fP\&. The fatal errors signal about something really bad that hurts
the overall Query Server process stability and productivity. For instance, if
you\(aqre using Python Query Server and some design function is unable to import
some third party module, it\(aqs better to count such error as fatal and
terminate whole process or you still have to do the same after import fixing,
but manually.
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBerror\fP
.sp
To raise an error, the Query Server have to answer:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["error", "error_name", "reason why"]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB"error_name"\fP helps to classify problems by their type e.g. if it\(aqs
\fB"value_error"\fP so probably user have entered wrong data, \fB"not_found"\fP
notifies about missed resource and \fB"type_error"\fP definitely says about
invalid and non expected input from user.
.sp
The \fB"reason why"\fP is the error message that explains why it raised and, if
possible, what is needed to do to fix it.
.sp
For example, calling \fIupdatefun\fP against non existent document could
produce next error message:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["error", "not_found", "Update function requires existent document"]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBforbidden\fP
.sp
The \fIforbidden\fP error is widely used by \fIvdufun\fP to stop further function
processing and prevent on disk store of the new document version. Since this
error actually is not an error, but an assertion against user actions, CouchDB
doesn\(aqt log it at \fI"error"\fP level, but returns \fIHTTP 403 Forbidden\fP response
with error information object.
.sp
To raise this error, the Query Server have to answer:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{"forbidden": "reason why"}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBunauthorized\fP
.sp
The \fIunauthorized\fP error mostly acts like \fIforbidden\fP one, but with
the meaning of \fIplease authorize first\fP\&. This small difference helps end users
to understand what they can do to solve the problem. CouchDB doesn\(aqt log it at
\fI"error"\fP level, but returns \fIHTTP 401 Unauthorized\fP response with error
information object.
.sp
To raise this error, the Query Server have to answer:
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
Once the code is in place include the add on in your \fIsettings.json\fP so that it
gets included by the \fIrequire\fP task. Your addon is included in one of three
ways; a local path, a git URL or a name. Named plugins assume the plugin is in
the Fauxton base directory, addons with a git URL will be cloned into the
application, local paths will be copied. Addons included from a local path will
be cleaned out by the clean task, others are left alone.
.SH API REFERENCE
.sp
The components of the API URL path help determine the part of the CouchDB
server that is being accessed. The result is the structure of the URL request
both identifies and effectively describes the area of the database you are
accessing.
.sp
As with all URLs, the individual components are separated by a forward slash.
.sp
As a general rule, URL components and JSON fields starting with the \fB_\fP
(underscore) character represent a special component or entity within the
server or returned object. For example, the URL fragment \fB/_all_dbs\fP gets a
list of all of the databases in a CouchDB instance.
.sp
This reference is structured according to the URL structure, as below.
.SS API Basics
.sp
The CouchDB API is the primary method of interfacing to a CouchDB instance.
Requests are made using HTTP and requests are used to request information from
the database, store new data, and perform views and formatting of the
information stored within the documents.
.sp
Requests to the API can be categorised by the different areas of the CouchDB
system that you are accessing, and the HTTP method used to send the request.
Different methods imply different operations, for example retrieval of
information from the database is typically handled by the \fBGET\fP operation,
while updates are handled by either a \fBPOST\fP or \fBPUT\fP request. There are
some differences between the information that must be supplied for the
different methods. For a guide to the basic HTTP methods and request structure,
see \fIapi/format\fP\&.
.sp
For nearly all operations, the submitted data, and the returned data structure,
is defined within a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object. Basic information
on the content and data types for JSON are provided in \fIjson\fP\&.
.sp
Errors when accessing the CouchDB API are reported using standard HTTP Status
Codes. A guide to the generic codes returned by CouchDB are provided in
\fIerrors\fP\&.
.sp
When accessing specific areas of the CouchDB API, specific information and
examples on the HTTP methods and request, JSON structures, and error codes are
provided.
.SS Request Format and Responses
.sp
CouchDB supports the following HTTP request methods:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBGET\fP
.sp
Request the specified item. As with normal HTTP requests, the format of the
URL defines what is returned. With CouchDB this can include static items,
database documents, and configuration and statistical information. In most
cases the information is returned in the form of a JSON document.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBHEAD\fP
.sp
The \fBHEAD\fP method is used to get the HTTP header of a \fBGET\fP request
without the body of the response.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPOST\fP
.sp
Upload data. Within CouchDB \fBPOST\fP is used to set values, including
uploading documents, setting document values, and starting certain
administration commands.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBPUT\fP
.sp
Used to put a specified resource. In CouchDB \fBPUT\fP is used to create new
objects, including databases, documents, views and design documents.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBDELETE\fP
.sp
Deletes the specified resource, including documents, views, and design
documents.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCOPY\fP
.sp
A special method that can be used to copy documents and objects.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If you use an unsupported HTTP request type with an URL that does not support
the specified type then a \fB405 \- Resource Not Allowed\fP will be returned,
listing the supported HTTP methods. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "error":"method_not_allowed",
    "reason":"Only GET,HEAD allowed"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The CouchDB design document API and the functions when returning HTML (for
example as part of a show or list) enables you to include custom HTTP headers
through the \fBheaders\fP block of the return object.
.SS HTTP Headers
.sp
Because CouchDB uses HTTP for all communication, you need to ensure that the
correct HTTP headers are supplied (and processed on retrieval) so that you get
the right format and encoding. Different environments and clients will be more
or less strict on the effect of these HTTP headers (especially when not
present). Where possible you should be as specific as possible.
.SS Request Headers
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBAccept\fP
.sp
Specifies the list of accepted data types to be returned by the server (i.e.
that are accepted/understandable by the client). The format should be a list
of one or more MIME types, separated by colons.
.sp
For the majority of requests the definition should be for JSON data
(\fBapplication/json\fP). For attachments you can either specify the MIME type
explicitly, or use \fB*/*\fP to specify that all file types are supported. If
the \fBAccept\fP header is not supplied, then the \fB*/*\fP MIME type is assumed
(i.e. client accepts all formats).
.sp
The use of \fBAccept\fP in queries for CouchDB is not required, but is highly
recommended as it helps to ensure that the data returned can be processed by
the client.
.sp
If you specify a data type using the \fBAccept\fP header, CouchDB will honor
the specified type in the \fBContent\-type\fP header field returned. For
example, if you explicitly request \fBapplication/json\fP in the \fBAccept\fP of
a request, the returned HTTP headers will use the value in the returned
\fBContent\-type\fP field.
.sp
For example, when sending a request without an explicit \fBAccept\fP header, or
when specifying \fB*/*\fP:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

Cache\-Control: must\-revalidate
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
\fBContent\-type\fP
.sp
Specifies the content type of the information being supplied within the
request. The specification uses MIME type specifications. For the majority of
requests this will be JSON (\fBapplication/json\fP). For some settings the MIME
type will be plain text. When uploading attachments it should be the
corresponding MIME type for the attachment or binary
(\fBapplication/octet\-stream\fP).
.sp
The use of the \fBContent\-type\fP on a request is highly recommended.
.UNINDENT
.SS Response Headers
.sp
Response headers are returned by the server when sending back content and
include a number of different header fields, many of which are standard HTTP
response header and have no significance to CouchDB operation. The list of
response headers important to CouchDB are listed below.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBCache\-control\fP
.sp
The cache control HTTP response header provides a suggestion for client
caching mechanisms on how to treat the returned information. CouchDB
typically returns the \fBmust\-revalidate\fP, which indicates that the
information should be revalidated if possible. This is used to ensure that
the dynamic nature of the content is correctly updated.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBContent\-length\fP
.sp
The length (in bytes) of the returned content.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBContent\-type\fP
.sp
Specifies the MIME type of the returned data. For most request, the returned
MIME type is \fBtext/plain\fP\&. All text is encoded in Unicode (UTF\-8), and this
is explicitly stated in the returned \fBContent\-type\fP, as
\fBtext/plain;charset=utf\-8\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBEtag\fP
.sp
The \fBEtag\fP HTTP header field is used to show the revision for a document,
or a view.
.sp
ETags have been assigned to a map/reduce group (the collection of views in a
single design document). Any change to any of the indexes for those views
would generate a new ETag for all view URLs in a single design doc, even if
that specific view\(aqs results had not changed.
.sp
Each \fB_view\fP URL has its own ETag which only gets updated when changes are
made to the database that effect that index. If the index for that specific
view does not change, that view keeps the original ETag head (therefore
sending back \fB304 \- Not Modified\fP more often).
.IP \(bu 2
\fBTransfer\-Encoding\fP
.sp
If the response uses an encoding, then it is specified in this header field.
.sp
\fBTransfer\-Encoding: chunked\fP means that the response is sent in parts, a
method known as \fI\%chunked transfer encoding\fP\&. This is used when CouchDB does
not know beforehand the size of the data it will send (for example,
the \fIchanges feed\fP).
.UNINDENT
.SS JSON Basics
.sp
The majority of requests and responses to CouchDB use the JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON) for formatting the content and structure of the data and
responses.
.sp
JSON is used because it is the simplest and easiest solution for working with
data within a web browser, as JSON structures can be evaluated and used as
JavaScript objects within the web browser environment. JSON also integrates
with the server\-side JavaScript used within CouchDB.
.sp
JSON supports the same basic types as supported by JavaScript, these are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Array \- a list of values enclosed in square brackets. For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
["one", "two", "three"]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Boolean \- a \fBtrue\fP or \fBfalse\fP value. You can use these strings directly.
For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{ "value": true}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Number \- an integer or floating\-point number.
.IP \(bu 2
Object \- a set of key/value pairs (i.e. an associative array, or hash). The
key must be a string, but the value can be any of the supported JSON values.
For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "servings" : 4,
    "subtitle" : "Easy to make in advance, and then cook when ready",
    "cooktime" : 60,
    "title" : "Chicken Coriander"
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In CouchDB, the JSON object is used to represent a variety of structures,
including the main CouchDB document.
.IP \(bu 2
String \- this should be enclosed by double\-quotes and supports Unicode
characters and backslash escaping. For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"A String"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Parsing JSON into a JavaScript object is supported through the \fBJSON.parse()\fP
function in JavaScript, or through various libraries that will perform the
parsing of the content into a JavaScript object for you. Libraries for parsing
and generating JSON are available in many languages, including Perl, Python,
Ruby, Erlang and others.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Care should be taken to ensure that your JSON structures are valid,
invalid structures will cause CouchDB to return an HTTP status code of 500
(server error).
.UNINDENT

.SS Number Handling
.sp
Developers and users new to computer handling of numbers often encounter
suprises when expecting that a number stored in JSON format does not
necessarily return as the same number as compared character by character.
.sp
Any numbers defined in JSON that contain a decimal point or exponent will be
passed through the Erlang VM\(aqs idea of the "double" data type. Any numbers that
are used in views will pass through the view server\(aqs idea of a number (the
common JavaScript case means even integers pass through a double due to
JavaScript\(aqs definition of a number).
.sp
Consider this document that we write to CouchDB:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id":"30b3b38cdbd9e3a587de9b8122000cff",
    "number": 1.1
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now let’s read that document back from CouchDB:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "_id":"30b3b38cdbd9e3a587de9b8122000cff",
    "_rev":"1\-f065cee7c3fd93aa50f6c97acde93030",
    "number":1.1000000000000000888
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
What happens is CouchDB is changing the textual representation of the
result of decoding what it was given into some numerical format. In most
cases this is an \fI\%IEEE 754\fP double precision floating point number which
is exactly what almost all other languages use as well.
.sp
What Erlang does a bit differently than other languages is that it does not
attempt to pretty print the resulting output to use the shortest number of
characters. For instance, this is why we have this relationship:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ejson:encode(ejson:decode(<<"1.1">>)).
<<"1.1000000000000000888">>
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
What can be confusing here is that internally those two formats decode into the
same IEEE\-754 representation. And more importantly, it will decode into a
fairly close representation when passed through all major parsers that we know
about.
.sp
While we\(aqve only been discussing cases where the textual representation
changes, another important case is when an input value contains more precision
than can actually represented in a double. (You could argue that this case is
actually "losing" data if you don\(aqt accept that numbers are stored in doubles).
.sp
Here\(aqs a log for a couple of the more common JSON libraries that happen to be
on the author\(aqs machine:

As you can see they all pretty much behave the same except for Ruby actually
does appear to be losing some precision over the other libraries.
.sp
The astute observer will notice that ejson (the CouchDB JSON library) reported
an extra three digits. While its tempting to think that this is due to some
internal difference, its just a more specific case of the 1.1 input as
described above.
.sp
The important point to realize here is that a double can only hold a finite
number of values. What we\(aqre doing here is generating a string that when passed
through the "standard" floating point parsing algorithms (ie, \fBstrtod\fP) will
result in the same bit pattern in memory as we started with. Or, slightly
different, the bytes in a JSON serialized number are chosen such that they
refer to a single specific value that a double can represent.
.sp
The important point to understand is that we\(aqre mapping from one infinite set
onto a finite set. An easy way to see this is by reflecting on this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
1.0 == 1.00 == 1.000 = 1.(infinite zeroes)
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Obviously a computer can\(aqt hold infinite bytes so we have to decimate our
infinitely sized set to a finite set that can be represented concisely.
.sp
The game that other JSON libraries are playing is merely:
.sp
"How few characters do I have to use to select this specific value for a
double"
.sp
And that game has lots and lots of subtle details that are difficult to
duplicate in C without a significant amount of effort (it took Python over a
year to get it sorted with their fancy build systems that automatically run on
a number of different architectures).
.sp
Hopefully we\(aqve shown that CouchDB is not doing anything "funky" by changing
input. Its behaving the same as any other common JSON library does, its just
not pretty printing its output.
.sp
On the other hand, if you actually are in a position where an IEEE\-754 double
is not a satisfactory datatype for your numbers, then the answer as has been
stated is to not pass your numbers through this representation. In JSON this is
accomplished by encoding them as a string or by using integer types (although
integer types can still bite you if you use a platform that has a different
integer representation than normal, ie, JavaScript).
.sp
Further information can be found easily, including the
\fI\%Floating Point Guide\fP, and  \fI\%David Goldberg\(aqs Reference\fP\&.
.sp
Also, if anyone is really interested in changing this behavior, we\(aqre all ears
for contributions to \fI\%jiffy\fP (which is theoretically going to replace ejson
when we get around to updating the build system). The places we\(aqve looked for
inspiration are TCL and Python. If you know a decent implementation of this
float printing algorithm give us a holler.
.SS HTTP Status Codes
.sp
With the interface to CouchDB working through HTTP, error codes and statuses
are reported using a combination of the HTTP status code number, and
corresponding data in the body of the response data.
.sp
A list of the error codes returned by CouchDB, and generic descriptions of the
related errors are provided below. The meaning of different status codes for
specific request types are provided in the corresponding API call reference.

ETag system to identify the version of information returned.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB400 \- Bad Request\fP
.sp
Bad request structure. The error can indicate an error with the request URL,
path or headers. Differences in the supplied MD5 hash and content also
trigger this error, as this may indicate message corruption.

.SS Replication Operation
.sp
The aim of the replication is that at the end of the process, all active
documents on the source database are also in the destination database and all
documents that were deleted in the source databases are also deleted (if they
exist) on the destination database.
.sp
Replication can be described as either push or pull replication:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIPull replication\fP is where the \fBsource\fP is the remote CouchDB instance,
and the \fBtarget\fP is the local database.
.sp
Pull replication is the most useful solution to use if your source database
has a permanent IP address, and your destination (local) database may have a
dynamically assigned IP address (for example, through DHCP). This is
particularly important if you are replicating to a mobile or other device
from a central server.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIPush replication\fP is where the \fBsource\fP is a local database, and
\fBtarget\fP is a remote database.
.UNINDENT
.SS Specifying the Source and Target Database
.sp
You must use the URL specification of the CouchDB database if you want to
perform replication in either of the following two situations:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Replication with a remote database (i.e. another instance of CouchDB on the
same host, or a different host)
.IP \(bu 2
Replication with a database that requires authentication
.UNINDENT
.sp
For example, to request replication between a database local to the CouchDB
instance to which you send the request, and a remote database you might use the
following request:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1
Content\-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

    "target" : "http://coucdb\-remote:5984/recipes",
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In all cases, the requested databases in the \fBsource\fP and \fBtarget\fP
specification must exist. If they do not, an error will be returned within the
JSON object:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
    "error" : "db_not_found"
    "reason" : "could not open http://couchdb\-remote:5984/ol1ka/",
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can create the target database (providing your user credentials allow it)
by adding the \fBcreate_target\fP field to the request object:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
POST http://couchdb:5984/_replicate HTTP/1.1

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBcreate_target\fP field is not destructive. If the database already
exists, the replication proceeds as normal.
.SS Single Replication
.sp
You can request replication of a database so that the two databases can be
synchronized. By default, the replication process occurs one time and
synchronizes the two databases together. For example, you can request a single
synchronization between two databases by supplying the \fBsource\fP and
\fBtarget\fP fields within the request JSON content.

.SS Cookie Authentication
.sp
For cookie authentication (\fI\%RFC 2109\fP) CouchDB generates a token that the
client can use for the next few requests to CouchDB. Tokens are valid until
a timeout. When CouchDB sees a valid token in a subsequent request, it will
authenticate the user by this token without requesting the password again. By
default, cookies are valid for 10 minutes, but it\(aqs \fBadjustable\fP\&. Also it\(aqs possible to make cookies
\fBpersistent\fP\&.

\fIProxy authentication\fP is very useful in case your application already uses
some external authentication service and you don\(aqt want to duplicate users and
their roles in CouchDB.

This authentication method allows creation of a \fIuserctx_object\fP for
remotely authenticated user. By default, the client just need to pass specific
headers to CouchDB with related request:

.SS OAuth Authentication
.sp
CouchDB supports OAuth 1.0 authentication (\fI\%RFC 5849\fP). OAuth provides a
method for clients to access server resources  without sharing real credentials
(username and password).
.sp
First, \fIconfigure oauth\fP, by setting consumer and token
with their secrets and binding token to real CouchDB username.
.sp
Probably, it\(aqs not good idea to work with plain curl, let use some scripting
language like Python:

consumer = oauth.OAuthConsumer(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET)
token = oauth.OAuthToken(TOKEN, SECRET)
req = oauth.OAuthRequest.from_consumer_and_token(

    token=token,
    http_method=\(aqGET\(aq,

req.sign_request(oauth.OAuthSignatureMethod_HMAC_SHA1(), consumer,token)

.SS Databases
.sp
The Database endpoint provides an interface to an entire database with in
CouchDB. These are database\-level, rather than document\-level requests.
.sp
For all these requests, the database name within the URL path
should be the database name that you wish to perform the operation on.
For example, to obtain the meta information for the database
\fBrecipes\fP, you would use the HTTP request:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
GET /recipes
.ft P

For clarity, the form below is used in the URL paths:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS Batch Mode Writes
.sp
You can write documents to the database at a higher rate by using the
batch option. This collects document writes together in memory (on a
user\-by\-user basis) before they are committed to disk. This increases
the risk of the documents not being stored in the event of a failure,
since the documents are not written to disk immediately.
.sp
To use the batched mode, append the \fBbatch=ok\fP query argument to the
URL of the \fBPUT\fP or \fBPOST /{db}\fP request. The CouchDB server will
respond with a HTTP \fI\%202 Accepted\fP response code immediately.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Creating or updating documents with batch mode doesn\(aqt guarantee that all
documents will be successfully stored on disk. For example, individual
documents may not be saved due to conflicts, rejection by
\fIvalidation function\fP or by other reasons, even if overall
the batch was sucessfully submitted.

.SS Inserting Documents in Bulk
.sp
Each time a document is stored or updated in CouchDB, the internal B\-tree
is updated. Bulk insertion provides efficiency gains in both storage space,
and time, by consolidating many of the updates to intermediate B\-tree nodes.
.sp
It is not intended as a way to perform \fBACID\fP\-like transactions in CouchDB,
the only transaction boundary within CouchDB is a single update to a single
database. The constraints are detailed in \fIapi/db/bulk_docs/semantics\fP\&.
.sp
To insert documents in bulk into a database you need to supply a JSON
structure with the array of documents that you want to add to the database.
You can either include a document ID, or allow the document ID to be
automatically generated.
.sp
For example, the following update inserts three new documents, two with the
supplied document IDs, and one which will have a document ID generated:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Bulk Documents Transaction Semantics
.sp
CouchDB supports two different modes for updating (or inserting)
documents using the bulk documentation system. Each mode affects both
the state of the documents in the event of system failure, and the level
of conflict checking performed on each document. The two modes are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnon\-atomic\fP
.sp
The default mode is \fInon\-atomic\fP, that is, CouchDB will only guarantee
that some of the documents will be saved when you send the request.
The response will contain the list of documents successfully inserted
or updated during the process. In the event of a crash, some of the
documents may have been successfully saved, and some will have been
lost.
.sp
In this mode, the response structure will indicate whether the
document was updated by supplying the new \fB_rev\fP parameter
indicating a new document revision was created. If the update failed,
then you will get an \fBerror\fP of type \fBconflict\fP\&. For example:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[
    {
        "id" : "FishStew",
        "error" : "conflict",
        "reason" : "Document update conflict."
    },
    {
        "id" : "LambStew",
        "error" : "conflict",
        "reason" : "Document update conflict."
    },
    {
        "id" : "BeefStew",
        "error" : "conflict",
        "reason" : "Document update conflict."
    }
]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this case no new revision has been created and you will need to
submit the document update, with the correct revision tag, to update
the document.

Replication of documents is independent of the type of insert or update.
The documents and revisions created during a bulk insert or update are
replicated in the same way as any other document. This can mean that if
you make use of the \fIall\-or\-nothing\fP mode the exact list of documents,
revisions (and their conflict state) may or may not be replicated to
other databases correctly.
.SS Bulk Document Validation and Conflict Errors
.sp
The JSON returned by the \fB_bulk_docs\fP operation consists of an array
of JSON structures, one for each document in the original submission.
The returned JSON structure should be examined to ensure that all of the
documents submitted in the original request were successfully added to
the database.
.sp
When a document (or document revision) is not correctly committed to the
database because of an error, you should check the \fBerror\fP field to
determine error type and course of action. Errors will be one of the
following type:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBconflict\fP
.sp
The document as submitted is in conflict. If you used the default
bulk transaction mode then the new revision will not have been
created and you will need to re\-submit the document to the database.
If you used \fBall\-or\-nothing\fP mode then you will need to manually
resolve the conflicted revisions of the document.
.sp
Conflict resolution of documents added using the bulk docs interface
is identical to the resolution procedures used when resolving
conflict errors during replication.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBforbidden\fP
.sp
Entries with this error type indicate that the validation routine
applied to the document during submission has returned an error.
.sp
For example, if your \fIvalidation routine\fP includes
the following:
.INDENT 2.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
throw({forbidden: \(aqinvalid recipe ingredient\(aq});
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT

The error response returned will be:

.SS Selector Syntax
.sp
Selectors are expressed as a JSON object describing documents of interest.
Within this structure, you can apply conditional logic using specially named
fields.
.sp
Whilst selectors have some similarities with MongoDB query documents, these
arise from a similarity of purpose and do not necessarily extend to commonality
of function or result.
.SS Selector Basics
.sp
Elementary selector syntax requires you to specify one or more fields, and the
corresponding values required for those fields. This selector matches all
documents whose "director" field has the value "Lars von Trier".
.INDENT 0.0

You can create more complex selector expressions by combining operators.
However, you cannot use \(aqcombination\(aq or \(aqarray logical\(aq operators such as
\fB$regex\fP as the basis of a query. Only the equality operators such as \fB$eq\fP,
\fB$gt\fP, \fB$gte\fP, \fB$lt\fP, and \fB$lte\fP (but not \fB$ne\fP) can be used as the
basis of a more complex query. For more information about creating complex
selector expressions, see \fIcreating selector expressions\fP\&.
.SS Selector with 2 fields

and that also has a location field with the value \fB"Boston"\fP\&.

objects, or subfields. For example, you might use a standard JSON structure for
specifying a field and subfield.

.SS Operators
.sp
Operators are identified by the use of a dollar sign ($) prefix in the name
field.
.sp
There are two core types of operators in the selector syntax:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Combination operators
.IP \(bu 2
Condition operators
.UNINDENT
.sp
In general, combination operators are applied at the topmost level of selection.
They are used to combine conditions, or to create combinations of conditions,
into one selector.
.sp
Every explicit operator has the form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{"$operator": argument}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A selector without an explicit operator is considered to have an implicit
operator. The exact implicit operator is determined by the structure of the
selector expression.
.SS Implicit Operators
.sp
There are two implicit operators:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Equality
.IP \(bu 2
And
.UNINDENT
.sp
In a selector, any field containing a JSON value, but that has no operators in
it, is considered to be an equality condition. The implicit equality test
applies also for fields and subfields.
.sp
Any JSON object that is not the argument to a condition operator is an implicit
$and operator on each field.
.sp
In the below example, we use an operator to match any document, where the
\fB"year"\fP field has a value greater than \fB2010\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

Combination operators are used to combine selectors. In addition to the common
boolean operators found in most programming languages, there are two combination
operators (\fB$all\fP and \fB$elemMatch\fP) that help you work with JSON arrays.

A combination operator takes a single argument. The argument is either another
selector, or an array of selectors.

.SS Creating Selector Expressions
.sp
We have seen examples of combining selector expressions, such as \fIusing
explicit $and and $eq operators\fP\&.
.sp
In general, whenever you have an operator that takes an argument, that argument
can itself be another operator with arguments of its own. This enables us to
build up more complex selector expressions.
.sp
However, only equality operators such as \fB$eq\fP, \fB$gt\fP, \fB$gte\fP, \fB$lt\fP,
and \fB$lte\fP (but not \fB$ne\fP) can be used as the basis of a query. You should

For example, if you try to perform a query that attempts to match all documents
that have a field called \fIafieldname\fP containing a value that begins with the
letter \fIA\fP, this will trigger a warning because no index could be used and
the database performs a full scan of the primary index:

It\(aqs always recommended that you create an appropriate index when deploying

.sp
Most selector expressions work exactly as you would expect for the given
operator.
.SS Sort Syntax
.sp
The \fBsort\fP field contains a list of field name and direction pairs, expressed
as a basic array. The first field name and direction pair is the topmost level
of sort. The second pair, if provided, is the next level of sort.
.sp
The field can be any field, using dotted notation if desired for sub\-document
fields.
.sp
The direction value is \fB"asc"\fP for ascending, and \fB"desc"\fP for descending.
If you omit the direction value, the default \fB"asc"\fP is used.
.sp
Example, sorting by 2 fields:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[{"fieldName1": "desc"}, {"fieldName2": "desc" }]

A typical requirement is to search for some content using a selector, then to
sort the results according to the specified field, in the required direction.
.sp
To use sorting, ensure that:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
At least one of the sort fields is included in the selector.
.IP \(bu 2
.INDENT 2.0
.TP
.B There is an index already defined, with all the sort fields in the same
order.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
Each object in the sort array has a single key.
.UNINDENT
.sp
If an object in the sort array does not have a single key, the resulting sort
order is implementation specific and might change.
.sp
Find does not support multiple fields with different sort orders, so the
directions must be either all ascending or all descending.
.SS Filtering Fields
.sp
It is possible to specify exactly which fields are returned for a document when
selecting from a database. The two advantages are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.INDENT 2.0
.TP
.B Your results are limited to only those parts of the document that are
required for your application.
.UNINDENT
.IP \(bu 2
A reduction in the size of the response.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The fields returned are specified as an array.
.sp
Only the specified filter fields are included, in the response. There is no
automatic inclusion of the \fB_id\fP or other metadata fields when a field list
is included.
.sp
Example of selective retrieval of fields from matching documents:

.SS Long Polling
.sp
The \fIlongpoll\fP feed, probably most applicable for a browser, is a more
efficient form of polling that waits for a change to occur before the response
is sent. \fIlongpoll\fP avoids the need to frequently poll CouchDB to discover
nothing has changed!
.sp
The request to the server will remain open until a change is made on the
database and is subsequently transferred, and then the connection will close.
This is low load for both server and client.
.sp
The response is basically the same JSON as is sent for the \fInormal\fP feed.
.sp
Because the wait for a change can be significant you can set a
timeout before the connection is automatically closed (the
\fBtimeout\fP argument). You can also set a heartbeat interval (using
the \fBheartbeat\fP query argument), which sends a newline to keep the
connection active.
.SS Continuous
.sp
Continually polling the CouchDB server is not ideal \- setting up new HTTP
connections just to tell the client that nothing happened puts unnecessary
strain on CouchDB.
.sp
A continuous feed stays open and connected to the database until explicitly
closed and changes are sent to the client as they happen, i.e. in near
real\-time.
.sp
As with the \fIlongpoll\fP feed type you can set both the timeout and heartbeat
intervals to ensure that the connection is kept open for new changes
and updates.
.sp
The continuous feed\(aqs response is a little different than the other feed types
to simplify the job of the client \- each line of the response is either empty
or a JSON object representing a single change, as found in the normal feed\(aqs
results.

.SS Filtering
.sp
You can filter the contents of the changes feed in a number of ways. The
most basic way is to specify one or more document IDs to the query. This
causes the returned structure value to only contain changes for the
specified IDs. Note that the value of this query argument should be a
JSON formatted array.
.sp
You can also filter the \fB_changes\fP feed by defining a filter function
within a design document. The specification for the filter is the same
as for replication filters. You specify the name of the filter function
to the \fBfilter\fP parameter, specifying the design document name and
\fIfilter name\fP\&. For example:

\fBdoc_ids\fP query parameter or payload\(aqs object array. See
\fBPOST /{db}/_changes\fP for an example.
.SS _selector
.sp
New in version 2.0.

.sp
This filter accepts only changes for documents which match a specified
selector, defined using the same \fIselector
syntax\fP used for \fI_find\fP\&.
.sp
This is more significantly more efficient than using a JavaScript filter
function and is the recommended option if filtering on document attributes only.

.SS _view
.sp
New in version 1.2.

.sp
The special filter \fB_view\fP allows to use existing
\fImap function\fP as the \fIfilter\fP\&. If the map
function emits anything for the processed document it counts as accepted and
the changes event emits to the feed. For most use\-practice cases \fIfilter\fP
functions are very similar to \fImap\fP ones, so this feature helps to reduce
amount of duplicated code.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
While \fImap functions\fP doesn\(aqt process the design documents,
using \fB_view\fP filter forces them to do this. You need to be sure, that
they are ready to handle documents with \fIalien\fP structure without panic
crush.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Using \fB_view\fP filter doesn\(aqt queries the view index files, so you cannot
use common \fIview query parameters\fP to additionally
filter the changes feed by index key. Also, CouchDB doesn\(aqt returns
the result instantly as it does for views \- it really uses the specified
map function as filter.
.sp
Moreover, you cannot make such filters dynamic e.g. process the request
query parameters or handle the \fIuserctx_object\fP \- the map function is
only operates with the document.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B POST /{db}/_compact
Request compaction of the specified database. Compaction compresses the
disk database file by performing the following operations:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Writes a new, optimised, version of the database file, removing any
unused sections from the new version during write. Because a new file is
temporarily created for this purpose, you may require up to twice the
current storage space of the specified database in order for the
compaction routine to complete.
.IP \(bu 2
Removes old revisions of documents from the database, up to the
per\-database limit specified by the \fB_revs_limit\fP database
parameter.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Compaction can only be requested on an individual database; you cannot
compact all the databases for a CouchDB instance. The compaction process
runs as a background process.
.sp
You can determine if the compaction process is operating on a database
by obtaining the database meta information, the \fBcompact_running\fP
value of the returned database structure will be set to true. See
\fBGET /{db}\fP\&.
.sp
You can also obtain a list of running processes to determine whether
compaction is currently running. See \fIapi/server/active_tasks\fP\&.

.B GET /{db}/_security
Returns the current security object from the specified database.
.sp
The security object consists of two compulsory elements, \fBadmins\fP
and \fBmembers\fP, which are used to specify the list of users and/or roles
that have admin and members rights to the database respectively:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmembers\fP: they can read all types of documents from the DB, and they
can write (and edit) documents to the DB except for design documents.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBadmins\fP: they have all the privileges of \fBmembers\fP plus the
privileges: write (and edit) design documents, add/remove database admins
and members and set the \fIdatabase revisions limit\fP\&. They can not create a database nor delete a
database.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Both \fBmembers\fP and \fBadmins\fP objects are contains two array\-typed
fields:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnames\fP: List of CouchDB user names
.IP \(bu 2
\fBroles\fP: List of users roles
.UNINDENT
.sp
Any other additional fields in the security object are optional.
The entire security object is made available to validation and other
internal functions so that the database can control and limit
functionality.
.sp
If both the names and roles fields of either the admins or members
properties are empty arrays, it means the database has no admins or
members.
.sp
Having no admins, only server admins (with the reserved \fB_admin\fP role)
are able to update design document and make other admin level changes.
.sp
Having no members, any user can write regular documents (any non\-design
document) and read documents from the database.
.sp
If there are any member names or roles defined for a database, then only
authenticated users having a matching name or role are allowed to read
documents from the database (or do a \fBGET /{db}\fP call).
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
If the security object for a database has never been set, then the
value returned will be empty.
.sp
Also note, that security objects are not regular versioned documents
(that is, they are not under MVCC rules). This is a design choice to
speedup authorization checks (avoids traversing a database\(gas documents
B\-Tree).

.SS \fB/db/_purge\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B POST /{db}/_purge
A database purge permanently removes the references to deleted documents
from the database. Normal deletion of a document within CouchDB does not
remove the document from the database, instead, the document is marked as
\fB_deleted=true\fP (and a new revision is created). This is to ensure that
deleted documents can be replicated to other databases as having been
deleted. This also means that you can check the status of a document and
identify that the document has been deleted by its absence.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Purging a document from a database should only be done as a last resort
when sensitive information has been introduced inadvertently into a
database. In clustered or replicated environments it is very difficult
to guarantee that a particular purged document has been removed from
all replicas. Do not rely on this API as a way of doing secure
deletion.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The purge operation removes the references to the deleted documents from
the database. The purging of old documents is not replicated to other
databases. If you are replicating between databases and have deleted a
large number of documents you should run purge on each database.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Purging documents does not remove the space used by them on disk. To
reclaim disk space, you should run a database compact (see
\fIapi/db/compact\fP), and compact views
(see \fIapi/db/compact/ddoc\fP).
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The format of the request must include the document ID and one or more
revisions that must be purged.
.sp
The response will contain the purge sequence number, and a list of the
document IDs and revisions successfully purged.

.SS Updating Indexes
.sp
The number of purges on a database is tracked using a purge sequence. This is
used by the view indexer to optimize the updating of views that contain the
purged documents.
.sp
When the indexer identifies that the purge sequence on a database has changed,
it compares the purge sequence of the database with that stored in the view
index. If the difference between the stored sequence and database is sequence
is only 1, then the indexer uses a cached list of the most recently purged
documents, and then removes these documents from the index individually. This
prevents completely rebuilding the index from scratch.
.sp
If the difference between the stored sequence number and current database
sequence is greater than 1, then the view index is entirely rebuilt. This is
an expensive operation as every document in the database must be examined.

Given a set of document/revision IDs, returns the subset of those that do
not correspond to revisions stored in the database.
.sp
Its primary use is by the replicator, as an important optimization: after
receiving a set of new revision IDs from the source database, the
replicator sends this set to the destination database\(aqs \fB_revs_diff\fP to
find out which of them already exist there. It can then avoid fetching and
sending already\-known document bodies.

document IDs; but the values are structured differently:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
In the request, a value is an array of revision IDs for that document.
.IP \(bu 2
In the response, a value is an object with a \fBmissing\fP: key, whose
value is a list of revision IDs for that document (the ones that are not
stored in the database) and optionally a \fBpossible_ancestors\fP key,
whose value is an array of revision IDs that are known that might be
ancestors of the missing revisions.

.B HEAD /{db}/{docid}
Returns the HTTP Headers containing a minimal amount of information about
the specified document. The method supports the same query arguments as the
\fBGET /{db}/{docid}\fP method, but only the header information (including
document size, and the revision as an ETag), is returned.
.sp
The \fI\%ETag\fP header shows the current revision for the requested
document, and the \fI\%Content\-Length\fP specifies the length of the
data, if the document were requested in full.

Alternatively, you can upload a document with attachments more efficiently in
\fImultipart/related\fP format. This avoids having to Base64\-encode
the attachments, saving CPU and bandwidth. To do this, set the
\fI\%Content\-Type\fP header of the \fBPUT /{db}/{docid}\fP request to
\fImultipart/related\fP\&.
.sp
The first MIME body is the document itself, which should have its own
\fI\%Content\-Type\fP of \fIapplication/json"\fP\&. It also should
include  an \fB_attachments\fP metadata object in which each attachment object
has a key \fBfollows\fP with value \fBtrue\fP\&.

.SS HTTP Range Requests
.sp
HTTP allows you to specify byte ranges for requests. This allows the
implementation of resumable downloads and skippable audio and video streams
alike. This is available for all attachments inside CouchDB.
.sp
This is just a real quick run through how this looks under the hood. Usually,
you will have larger binary files to serve from CouchDB, like MP3s and videos,
but to make things a little more obvious, I use a text file here (Note that I
use the \fIapplication/octet\-stream\fP :header\(gaContent\-Type\(ga instead of
\fItext/plain\fP).

.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell> cat file.txt

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now let\(aqs store this text file as an attachment in CouchDB. First, we create a
database:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell> curl \-X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/test
{"ok":true}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then we create a new document and the file attachment in one go:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell> curl \-X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/test/doc/file.txt \e
            \-H "Content\-Type: application/octet\-stream" \-d@file.txt

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now we can request the whole file easily:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
shell> curl \-X GET http://127.0.0.1:5984/test/doc/file.txt

HTTP supports many ways to specify single and even multiple byte
ranges. Read all about it in \fI\%RFC 2616\fP\&.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Databases that have been created with CouchDB 1.0.2 or earlier will support
range requests in 2.0, but they are using a less\-optimal algorithm.
If you plan to make heavy use of this feature, make sure to compact your
database with CouchDB 2.0 to take advantage of a better algorithm to
find byte ranges.

.SS Design Documents
.sp
In CouchDB, design documents provide the main interface for building a CouchDB
application. The design document defines the views used to extract information
from CouchDB through one or more views. Design documents are created within
your CouchDB instance in the same way as you create database documents, but the
content and definition of the documents is different. Design Documents are
named using an ID defined with the design document URL path, and this URL can
then be used to access the database contents.
.sp
Views and lists operate together to provide automated (and formatted) output
from your database.
.SS \fB/db/_design/design\-doc\fP

Note, that for \fBfilters\fP, \fBlists\fP, \fBshows\fP and \fBupdates\fP fields
objects are mapping of function name to string function source code. For
\fBviews\fP mapping is the same except that values are objects with \fBmap\fP

.SS View Options
.sp
There are two view indexing options that can be defined in a design document
as boolean properties of an \fBoptions\fP object. Unlike the others querying
options, these aren\(aqt URL parameters because they take effect when the view
index is generated, not when it\(aqs accessed:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlocal_seq\fP (\fIboolean\fP): Makes documents\(aq local sequence numbers available
to map functions (as a \fB_local_seq\fP document property)
.IP \(bu 2
\fBinclude_design\fP (\fIboolean\fP): Allows map functions to be called on design
documents as well as regular documents
.UNINDENT
.SS Querying Views and Indexes
.sp
The definition of a view within a design document also creates an index based
on the key information defined within each view. The production and use of the
index significantly increases the speed of access and searching or selecting
documents from the view.
.sp
However, the index is not updated when new documents are added or modified in
the database. Instead, the index is generated or updated, either when the view
is first accessed, or when the view is accessed after a document has been
updated. In each case, the index is updated before the view query is executed
against the database.
.sp
View indexes are updated incrementally in the following situations:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A new document has been added to the database.
.IP \(bu 2
A document has been deleted from the database.
.IP \(bu 2
A document in the database has been updated.
.UNINDENT
.sp
View indexes are rebuilt entirely when the view definition changes. To achieve
this, a \(aqfingerprint\(aq of the view definition is created when the design
document is updated. If the fingerprint changes, then the view indexes are
entirely rebuilt. This ensures that changes to the view definitions are
reflected in the view indexes.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
View index rebuilds occur when one view from the same the view group (i.e.
all the views defined within a single a design document) has been
determined as needing a rebuild. For example, if if you have a design
document with different views, and you update the database, all three view
indexes within the design document will be updated.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Because the view is updated when it has been queried, it can result in a delay
in returned information when the view is accessed, especially if there are a
large number of documents in the database and the view index does not exist.
There are a number of ways to mitigate, but not completely eliminate, these
issues. These include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Create the view definition (and associated design documents) on your database
before allowing insertion or updates to the documents. If this is allowed
while the view is being accessed, the index can be updated incrementally.
.IP \(bu 2
Manually force a view request from the database. You can do this either
before users are allowed to use the view, or you can access the view manually
after documents are added or updated.
.IP \(bu 2
Use the \fIchanges feed\fP to monitor for changes to the
database and then access the view to force the corresponding view index to be
updated.
.IP \(bu 2
Use a monitor with the \fIupdate notification\fP
section of the CouchDB configuration file to monitor for changes to your
database, and trigger a view query to force the view to be updated.
.UNINDENT
.sp
None of these can completely eliminate the need for the indexes to be rebuilt
or updated when the view is accessed, but they may lessen the effects on
end\-users of the index update affecting the user experience.
.sp
Another alternative is to allow users to access a \(aqstale\(aq version of the view
index, rather than forcing the index to be updated and displaying the updated
results. Using a stale view may not return the latest information, but will
return the results of the view query using an existing version of the index.
.sp
For example, to access the existing stale view \fBby_recipe\fP in the
\fBrecipes\fP design document:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
http://localhost:5984/recipes/_design/recipes/_view/by_recipe?stale=ok
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Accessing a stale view:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Does not trigger a rebuild of the view indexes, even if there have been
changes since the last access.
.IP \(bu 2
Returns the current version of the view index, if a current version exists.
.IP \(bu 2
Returns an empty result set if the given view index does exist.
.UNINDENT
.sp
As an alternative, you use the \fBupdate_after\fP value to the \fBstale\fP
parameter. This causes the view to be returned as a stale view, but for the
update process to be triggered after the view information has been returned to
the client.
.sp
In addition to using stale views, you can also make use of the \fBupdate_seq\fP
query argument. Using this query argument generates the view information
including the update sequence of the database from which the view was
generated. The returned value can be compared this to the current update
sequence exposed in the database information (returned by \fBGET /{db}\fP).
.SS Sorting Returned Rows
.sp
Each element within the returned array is sorted using native UTF\-8 sorting
according to the contents of the key portion of the emitted content. The basic
order of output is as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnull\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBfalse\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtrue\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Numbers
.IP \(bu 2
Text (case sensitive, lowercase first)
.IP \(bu 2
Arrays (according to the values of each element, in order)
.IP \(bu 2
Objects (according to the values of keys, in key order)

.SS Sorting order and startkey/endkey

The sorting direction is applied before the filtering applied using the

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.UNINDENT
.sp
will operate correctly when listing all the matching entries between

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The results will be empty because the entries in the view are reversed before
the key filter is applied, and therefore the \fBendkey\fP of “egg” will be seen
before the \fBstartkey\fP of “carrots”, resulting in an empty list.
.sp
Instead, you should reverse the values supplied to the \fBstartkey\fP and
\fBendkey\fP parameters to match the descending sorting applied to the keys.

It use pattern matching for that
.IP \(bu 2
\fBto\fP (\fIstring\fP): Rule to rewrite an url. It can contain variables
depending on  binding variables discovered during pattern matching and

.IP \(bu 2
\fBmethod\fP (\fIstring\fP): HTTP request method to bind the request method to
the rule. Default is \fB"*"\fP
.IP \(bu 2

dynamic variable by binding the key
.UNINDENT

The \fBto\(ga\(gaand \(ga\(gafrom\fP paths may contains string patterns with leading
\fB:\fP or \fB*\fP characters.
.sp
For example: \fB/somepath/:var/*\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
This path is converted in Erlang list by splitting \fB/\fP
.IP \(bu 2
Each \fBvar\fP are converted in atom
.IP \(bu 2
\fB""\fP are converted to \fB\(aq\(aq\fP atom
.IP \(bu 2
The pattern matching is done by splitting \fB/\fP in request url in a list
of token
.IP \(bu 2
A string pattern will match equal token
.IP \(bu 2
The star atom (\fB\(aq*\(aq\fP in single quotes) will match any number of tokens,
but may only be present as the last \fIpathterm\fP in a \fIpathspec\fP
.IP \(bu 2
If all tokens are matched and all \fIpathterms\fP are used, then the
\fIpathspec\fP matches
.UNINDENT
.sp
The pattern matching is done by first matching the HTTP request method to a
rule. \fBmethod\fP is equal to \fB"*"\fP by default, and will match any HTTP
method. It will then try to match the path to one rule. If no rule matches,
then a \fI\%404 Not Found\fP response returned.
.sp
Once a rule is found we rewrite the request url using the \fBto\fP and
\fBquery\fP fields. The identified token are matched to the rule and will
replace var. If \fB\(aq*\(aq\fP is found in the rule it will contain the remaining
part if it exists.

.SS The Cluster Setup Wizard
.sp
Setting up a cluster of Erlang applications correctly can be a daunting
task. Luckily, CouchDB 2.0 comes with a convenient Cluster Setup Wizard
as part of the Fauxton web administration interface.
.sp
After installation and initial startup, visit Fauxton at
\fBhttp://127.0.0.01:5984/_utils#setup\fP\&. You will be asked to set up
CouchDB as a single\-node instance or set up a cluster.
.sp
When you click "setup cluster" on the other hand, you are asked for
admin credentials again and then to add nodes by IP address. To get
more nodes, go through the same install procedure on other machines.
.sp
Before you can add nodes to form a cluster, you have to have them
listen on a public ip address and set up an admin user. Do this, once
per node:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
curl \-X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_node/couchdb@<this\-nodes\-ip\-address>/_config/admins/admin \-d \(aq"password"\(aq
curl \-X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5984/_node/couchdb@<this\-nodes\-ip\-address>/_config/chttpd/bind_address \-d \(aq"0.0.0.0"\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Now you can enter their IP addresses in the setup screen on your first
node. And make sure to put in the admin username and password. And use
the same admin username and password on all nodes.
.sp
Once you added all nodes, click "Setup" and Fauxton will finish the
cluster configuration for you.
.sp
See \fI\%http://127.0.0.1:5984/_membership\fP to get a list of all the nodes in
your cluster.
.sp
Now your cluster is ready and available. You can send requests to any
one of the nodes and get to all the data.
.sp
For a proper production setup, you\(aqd now set up a HTTP proxy in front
of the nodes, that does load balancing. We recommend \fI\%HAProxy\fP\&. See
our \fI\%example configuration for HAProxy\fP\&. All you need is to adjust the
ip addresses and ports.

.IP \(bu 2
\fBw\fP \- The number of nodes that need to save a document before a write is

.sp
When creating a database or doing a read or write you can send your own values
with request and thereby overriding the defaults in \fBdefault.ini\fP\&.
.sp
We will focus on the shards and replicas for now.
.sp
A shard is a part of a database. The more shards, the more you can scale out.
If you have 4 shards, that means that you can have at most 4 nodes. With one
shard you can have only one node, just the way CouchDB 1.x is.
.sp
Replicas adds fail resistance, as some nodes can be offline without everything
comes crashing down.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBn=1\fP All nodes must be up.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBn=2\fP Any 1 node can be down.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBn=3\fP Any 2 nodes can be down.
.IP \(bu 2
etc
.UNINDENT
.sp
Computers goes down and sysadmins pull out network cables in a furious rage from
time to time, so using \fBn<2\fP is asking for downtime. Having a to high value of
n is adding servers and complexity without any real benefit. The sweetspot is at
\fBn=3\fP\&.
.sp
Say that we have a database with 3 replicas and 4 shards. That would give us a
maximum of 12 nodes. 4*3=12 Every shard have 3 copies.
.sp
We can lose any 2 nodes and still read and write all documents.
.sp
What happens if we lose more nodes? It depends on how lucky we are. As long as
there is at least one copy of every shard online, we can read and write all
documents.
.sp
So, if we are very lucky then we can lose 8 nodes at maximum.

.SS Placing a database on specific nodes
.sp
In BigCouch, the predecessor to CouchDB 2.0\(aqs clustering functionality, there
was the concept of zones. CouchDB 2.0 carries this forward with cluster
placement rules.
.sp
First, each node must be labelled with a zone attribute. This defines which
zone each node is in. You do this by editing the node\(aqs document in the
\fB/nodes\fP database, which is accessed through the "back\-door" (5986) port.
Add a key value pair of the form:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"zone": "metro\-dc\-a"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Do this for all of the nodes in your cluster.
.sp
In your config file (local.ini or default.ini) on each node, define a
consistent cluster\-wide setting like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[cluster]
placement = metro\-dc\-a:2,metro\-dc\-b:1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In this example, it will ensure that two replicas for a shard will be hosted
on nodes with the zone attribute set to \fBmetro\-dc\-a\fP and one replica will
be hosted on a new wiht the zone attribute set to \fBmetro\-dc\-b\fP\&.

Note that you can also use this system to ensure certain nodes in the cluster
do not host \fIany\fP replicas for newly created databases, by giving them a zone
attribute that does not appear in the \fB[cluster]\fP placement string.
.SS Sharding
.SS Scaling out
.sp
Normally you start small and grow over time. In the beginning you might do just
fine with one node, but as your data and number of clients grows, you need to
scale out.
.sp
For simplicity we will start fresh and small.
.sp
Start node1 and add a database to it. To keep it simple we will have 2 shards
and no replicas.

Then press Save and marvel at the magic. The shards are now on node2 too! We
now have \fBn=2\fP!
.sp
If the shards are large, then you can copy them over manually and only have
CouchDB syncing the changes from the last minutes instead.
.SS Moving Shards
.SS Add, then delete
.sp
In the world of CouchDB there is no such thing as moving. You can add a new
replica to a shard and then remove the old replica, thereby creating the
illusion of moving. If you try to uphold this illusion with a database that have
\fBn=1\fP, you might find yourself in the following scenario:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Copy the shard to a new node.
.IP 2. 3
Update the metadata to use the new node.
.IP 3. 3
Delete the shard on the old node.
.IP 4. 3
Lose all writes made between 1 and 2.
.UNINDENT
.sp
As the realty "I added a new replica of the shard X on node Y and then I waited
for them to sync, before I removed the replica of shard X from node Z." is a bit
tedious, people and this documentation tend to use the illusion of moving.
.SS Moving
.sp
When you get to \fBn=3\fP you should start moving the shards instead of adding
more replicas.
.sp
We will stop on \fBn=2\fP to keep things simple. Start node number 3 and add it to
the cluster. Then create the directories for the shard on node3:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
mkdir \-p data/shards/00000000\-7fffffff
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And copy over \fBdata/shards/00000000\-7fffffff/small.1425202577.couch\fP from
node1 to node3. Do not move files between the shard directories as that will
confuse CouchDB!
.sp
Edit the database document in \fB_dbs\fP again. Make it so that node3 have a
replica of the shard \fB00000000\-7fffffff\fP\&. Save the document and let CouchDB
sync. If we do not do this, then writes made during the copy of the shard and
the updating of the metadata will only have \fBn=1\fP until CouchDB has synced.
.sp
Then update the metadata document so that node2 no longer have the shard
\fB00000000\-7fffffff\fP\&. You can now safely delete
\fBdata/shards/00000000\-7fffffff/small.1425202577.couch\fP on node 2.
.sp
The changelog is nothing that CouchDB cares about, it is only for the admins.
But for the sake of completeness, we will update it again. Use \fBdelete\fP for
recording the removal of the shard \fB00000000\-7fffffff\fP from node2.
.sp
Start node4, add it to the cluster and do the same as above with shard
\fB80000000\-ffffffff\fP\&.
.sp
All documents added during this operation was saved and all reads responded to
without the users noticing anything.
.SS Views
.sp
The views needs to be moved together with the shards. If you do not, then
CouchDB will rebuild them and this will take time if you have a lot of
documents.
.sp
The views are stored in \fBdata/.shards\fP\&.
.sp
It is possible to not move the views and let CouchDB rebuild the view every
time you move a shard. As this can take quite some time, it is not recommended.
.SS Reshard? No, Preshard!
.sp
Reshard? Nope. It can not be done. So do not create databases with to few
shards.
.sp
If you can not scale out more because you set the number of shards to low, then
you need to create a new cluster and migrate over.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 4
Build a cluster with enough nodes to handle one copy of your data.
.IP 2. 4
Create a database with the same name, n=1 and with enough shards so you do
not have to do this again.
.IP 3. 4
Set up 2 way replication between the 2 clusters.
.IP 4. 4
Let it sync.
.IP 5. 4
Tell clients to use both the clusters.
.IP 6. 4
Add some nodes to the new cluster and add them as replicas.
.IP 7. 4
Remove some nodes from the old cluster.
.IP 8. 4
Repeat 6 and 7 until you have enough nodes in the new cluster to have 3
replicas of every shard.
.IP 9. 4
Redirect all clients to the new cluster
.IP 10. 4
Turn off the 2 way replication between the clusters.
.IP 11. 4
Shut down the old cluster and add the servers as new nodes to the new
cluster.
.IP 12. 4
Relax!
.UNINDENT
.sp
Creating more shards than you need and then move the shards around is called
presharding. The number of shards you need depends on how much data you are
going to store. But creating to many shards increases the complexity without any
real gain. You might even get lower performance. As an example of this, we can
take the author\(aqs (15 year) old lab server. It gets noticeably slower with more
than one shard and high load, as the hard drive must seek more.
.sp
How many shards you should have depends, as always, on your use case and your
hardware. If you do not know what to do, use the default of 8 shards.

.SH EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
.sp
This is a list of experimental features in CouchDB. They are included in
a release because the development team is requesting feedback from the
larger developer community. As such, please play around with these features
and send us feedback, thanks!
.sp
Use at your own risk! Do not rely on these features for critical applications.
.SS NodeJS Query Server
.sp
The NodeJS Query Server is an alternative runtime environment for
the default JavaScript Query Server that runs on top of Node.JS and
not SpiderMonkey like the default Query Server.
.SS Setup
.sp
You will need to install Node.JS version 0.10.0 or later. See \fI\%Node.JS
Downloads\fP for options.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Install the \fIcouchjs\-node\fP binary. Either from the CouchDB sources:
.INDENT 3.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
cd src/couchjs\-node
npm link
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Or via NPM:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
npm install \-g couchjs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBNPM in non\-standard locations\fP
If your Node.JS installation doesn’t store binaries in \fI/usr/local/bin\fP
you will need to adjust CouchDB’s configuration. Add this to your
\fIlocal.ini\fP file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[query_servers]
nodejs = /path/to/couchjs\-node /path/to/couchdb/share/server/main.js
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
And then restart your CouchDB instance.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
2. Done. Now you can create design documents with the \fIlanguage\fP parameter
set to \fInodejs\fP and all JavaScript functions in this design document will
be processed by the Node.JS query server.
.sp
Enjoy!
.SS Differences from the SpiderMonkey Query Server
.sp
V8 and SpiderMonkey roughly behave similar, but there might be engine\- specific
differences that make or break a JavaScript function in one or the other server.
.SS Plugins
.sp
See \fIsrc/couch_plugins/README.md\fP\&.
.SS Content\-Security\-Policy (CSP) Header Support for /_utils (Fauxton)
.sp
This will just work with Fauxton, and not Futon. You can enable it
in your config: you can enable the feature in general and change
the default header that is sent for everything in /_utils.
.INDENT 0.0

.SH CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DOCUMENTATION
.sp
The documentation lives in the CouchDB source tree. We\(aqll start by forking and
closing the CouchDB GitHub mirror. That will allow us to send the contribution
to CouchDB with a pull request.
.sp
If you don\(aqt have a GitHub account yet, it is a good time to get one, they are
free. If you don\(aqt want to use GitHub, there are alternate ways to
contributing back, that we\(aqll cover next time.
.sp
Go to \fI\%https://github.com/apache/couchdb\fP and click the "fork" button in the top
right. This will create a fork of CouchDB in your GitHub account. Mine is
\fIjanl\fP, so my fork lives at \fI\%https://github.com/janl/couchdb\fP\&. In the header, it
tells me me my "GitHub Clone URL". We need to copy that and start a terminal:
.INDENT 0.0

.nf
.ft C
$ git clone https://github.com/janl/couchdb.git
$ cd couchdb
$ subl .

The documentation sources live in \fIshare/doc/src\fP, you can safely ignore all
the other files and directories.
.sp
First we should determine where we want to document this inside the
documentation. We can look through \fI\%http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/\fP
for inspiration. The \fI\%JSON Structure Reference\fP looks like a fine place to
write this up.
.sp
The current state includes mostly tables describing the JSON structure (after
all, that\(aqs the title of this chapter), but some prose about the number
representation can\(aqt hurt. For future reference, since the topic in the thread
includes views and different encoding in views (as opposed to the storage
engine), we should remember to make a note in the views documentation as well,
but we\(aqll leave this for later.
.sp
Let\(aqs try and find the source file that builds the file
\fI\%http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/json\-structure.html\fP \-\- we are in luck, under
\fIshare/doc/src\fP we find the file \fIjson\-structure.rst\fP\&. That looks promising.
\fI\&.rst\fP stands for ReStructured Text (see
\fI\%http://thomas\-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html\fP
for a markup reference), which is an ascii format for writing
documents, documentation in this case. Let\(aqs have a look and open it.
.sp
We see ascii tables with some additional formatting, all looking like the
final HTML. So far so easy. For now, let\(aqs just add to the bottom of this. We
can worry about organising this better later.
.sp
We start by adding a new headline:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.ft C

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.sp
Now we paste in the rest of the main email of the thread. It is mostly text,

And then follow all the other ones.
.sp
I cleaned up the text a little but to make it sound more like a documentation
entry as opposed to a post on a mailing list.
.sp
The next step would be to validate that we got all the markup right. I\(aqll
leave this for later. For now we\(aqll contribute our change back to CouchDB.
.sp
First, we commit our changes:

.nf
.ft C
$ git push origin master
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT

.sp
Next, we go back to our GitHub page \fI\%https://github.com/janl/couchdb\fP and click
the "Pull Request" button. Fill in the description with something useful and
hit the "Send Pull Request" button.
.sp
And we\(aqre done!
.SS Style Guidelines for this Documentation
.sp
When you make a change to the documentation, you should make sure that you
follow the style. Look through some files and you will see that the style is
quite straightforward. If you do not know if your formating is in compliance
with the style, ask yourself the following question:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Is it needed for correct syntax?
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the answer is \fBNo.\fP then it is probably not.
.sp
These guidelines strive be simple, without contradictions and exceptions. The
best style is the one that is followed because it seems to be the natural way of
doing it.

Native clustering is now supported. Rather than use CouchDB replication
between multiple, distinct CouchDB servers, configure a cluster of CouchDB
nodes. These nodes will use an optimized Erlang\-driven \(aqinternal replication\(aq
to ensure data durability and accessibility. Combine a clustered CouchDB with
a load balancer (such as \fBhaproxy\fP) to scale CouchDB out horizontally. More
details of the clustering feature are available in the \fIcluster\fP\&.

The new Mango Query Server provides a simple JSON\-based way to perform CouchDB
queries without JavaScript or MapReduce. Mango Queries have a similar indexing
speed advantage over JavaScript Quries than the Erlang Queries have (2x\-10x
faster indexing depending on doc size and system configuration). We recommend
all new apps start using Mango as a default. Further details are available
in the \fI_find, _index and _explain API\fP\&.

The following are some highlights of known issues for which fixes did not land
in time for the 2.0.0 release:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%COUCHDB\-2980\fP: The replicator (whether invoked via \fB_replicate\fP or a
document stored in the \fB_replicator\fP database) understands two kinds of
source and target:
.INDENT 2.0
.IP 1. 3
A URL (e.g., \fBhttps://foo:bar@foo.com/db1\fP), called a "remote" source or
target
.IP 2. 3
A database name (e.g., \fBdb1\fP), called a "local" source or target.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Whenever the latter type is used, this refers to a local unclustered
database, not a clustered one.
.sp
In a future release we hope to support "local" source or target specs to
clustered databases. For now, we recommend always using the URL format for
both source and target specifications.

You can upgrade your existing CouchDB 1.0.x installation to 1.3.0
without any specific steps or migration. When you run CouchDB, the
existing data and index files will be opened and used as normal.

The first time you run a compaction routine on your database within 1.3.0,
the data structure and indexes will be updated to the new version of the
CouchDB database format that can only be read by CouchDB 1.3.0 and later.
This step is not reversible. Once the data files have been updated and
migrated to the new version the data files will no longer work with a

The new optional (but enabled by default) compression of disk files requires
an upgrade of the on\-disk format (5 \-> 6) which occurs on creation for new
databases and views, and on compaction for existing files. This format is not
supported in previous releases, so rollback would require replication to the
previous CouchDB release or restoring from backup.

releases are not recommended for regular usage.

.SS Changes Between 0.11.0 and 0.11.1
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_log\fP and \fB_temp_views\fP are now admin\-only resources.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB_bulk_docs\fP now requires a valid \fIContent\-Type\fP header of
\fBapplication/json\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
\fIJSONP\fP is disabled by default. An .ini option was added to selectively
enable it.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBkey\fP, \fBstartkey\fP and \fBendkey\fP properties of the request object
passed to \fIlist\fP and \fIshow\fP functions now
contain JSON objects representing the URL encoded string values in the query
string. Previously, these properties contained strings which needed to be
converted to JSON before using.
.UNINDENT
.SS Changes Between 0.10.x and 0.11.0
.SS show, list, update and validation functions
.sp
The \fBreq\fP argument to show, list, update and validation functions now contains
the member method with the specified HTTP method of the current request.
Previously, this member was called \fBverb\fP\&. \fBmethod\fP is following \fI\%RFC 2616\fP
(HTTP 1.1) closer.
.SS _admins \-> _security
.sp
The \fI/db/_admins\fP handler has been removed and replaced with a
\fI/db/_security\fP object. Any existing \fI_admins\fP will be
dropped and need to be added to the security object again. The reason for this
is that the old system made no distinction between names and roles, while the
new one does, so there is no way to automatically upgrade the old admins list.
.sp
The security object has 2 special fields, \fBadmins\fP and \fBreaders\fP, which
contain lists of names and roles which are admins or readers on that database.
Anything else may be stored in other fields on the security object. The entire
object is made available to validation functions.
.SS json2.js
.sp
JSON handling in the query server has been upgraded to use \fI\%json2.js\fP\&.
This allows us to use faster native JSON serialization when it is available.
.sp
In previous versions, attempts to serialize undefined would throw an exception,
causing the doc that emitted undefined to be dropped from the view index.
The new behavior is to serialize undefined as null. Applications depending on
the old behavior will need to explicitly check for undefined.
.sp
Another change is that E4X\(aqs XML objects will not automatically be
stringified. XML users will need to call \fBmy_xml_object.toXMLString()\fP
to return a string value. \fI\%#8d3b7ab3\fP
.SS WWW\-Authenticate
.sp
The default configuration has been changed to avoid causing basic\-auth popups
which result from sending the WWW\-Authenticate header. To enable basic\-auth
popups, uncomment the \fBhttpd/WWW\-Authenticate\fP line in
\fIlocal.ini\fP\&.
.SS Query server line protocol
.sp
The query server line protocol has changed for all functions except
\fImap\fP, \fIreduce\fP, and
\fIrereduce\fP\&. This allows us to cache the entire design
document in the query server process, which results in faster performance for
common operations. It also gives more flexibility to query server
implementators and shouldn\(aqt require major changes in the future when adding
new query server features.
.SS UTF8 JSON
.sp
JSON request bodies are validated for proper UTF\-8 before saving, instead of
waiting to fail on subsequent read requests.
.SS _changes line format
.sp
Continuous changes are now newline delimited, instead of having each line
followed by a comma.

The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating
security problems and denial of service attacks against Apache CouchDB.
.sp
We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to our private security
mailing list first, before disclosing them in a public forum.
.sp
Please note that the security mailing list should only be used for reporting
undisclosed security vulnerabilities in Apache CouchDB and managing the
process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept regular bug reports
or other queries at this address. All mail sent to this address that does not
relate to an undisclosed security problem in the Apache CouchDB source code
will be ignored.

Note that all networked servers are subject to denial of service attacks,
and we cannot promise magic workarounds to generic problems (such as a client
streaming lots of data to your server, or re\-requesting the same URL
repeatedly). In general our philosophy is to avoid any attacks which can
cause the server to consume resources in a non\-linear relationship to the

         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
         wherever such third\-party notices normally appear. The contents
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
         as modifying the License.

     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
     the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
     of TITLE, NON\-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
