apache-couchdb (1.5.0-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #1234)
  * Backport of Trusty/CouchDB for new upstream release (LP: #1254371)
  * Includes following changes from Jason Gerard DeRose <jason@system76.com>
  * Don't include `couchdb` info page in `couchdb-bin` binary package as it
    provides no meaningful benefit over the `couchdb` man page (note this change
    means we don't need to add a Build-Depends on `install-info` for Trusty)
  * Remove Build-Depends: texlive-latex-base, texlive-latex-recommended,
    texlive-latex-extra, texlive-fonts-recommended, texinfo (as documentation
    thus produced doesn't get included in the binary packages anyway)
  * debian/rules: don't call ./configure with --enable-strictness as we dropped
    Build-Depends on `texlive-*`, `texinfo`, plus didn't add `install-info` 
  * Add Build-Depends: lsb-release (used for [vendor] info in default.ini)
  * debian/rules: insert proper [vendor] info in default.ini (note this should
    be improved once there is a better mechanism upstream)
  * debian/couchdb.upstart: start on filesystem and static-network-up,
    stop on deconfiguring-networking, plus add "author" line
